How can I speak in 10 minutes about the bon@@ ds of women over three generations , about how the ast@@ oni@@ shing strength of those bon@@ ds took hold in the life of a four@@ -year-old girl hu@@ dd@@ led with her young sister , her mother and her grandmother for five days and ni@@ ghts in a small boat in the China Se@@ a more than 30 years ago , bon@@ ds that took hold in the life of that small girl and never let go -- that small girl now living in San Francisco and speaking to you today ?
This is not a finished story .
It is a j@@ ig@@ saw puzz@@ le still being put together .
Let me tell you about some of the pieces .
Imagine the first piece : a man bur@@ ning his life &apos;s work .
He is a po@@ et , a pla@@ y@@ w@@ right , a man whose whole life had been bal@@ anced on the single hope of his country &apos;s un@@ ity and freedom .
Imagine him as the communi@@ sts enter Sa@@ ig@@ on , conf@@ ron@@ ting the fact that his life had been a complete waste .
Wor@@ ds , for so long his friends , now mo@@ cked him .
He re@@ treated into silence .
He died broken by history .
He is my grandfather .
I never knew him in real life .
But our lives are much more than our memories .
My grandmother never let me forget his life .
My du@@ ty was not to allow it to have been in va@@ in , and my lesson was to learn that , yes , history tried to cr@@ ush us , but we en@@ du@@ red .
The next piece of the j@@ ig@@ saw is of a boat in the early da@@ wn sli@@ pping sil@@ ently out to sea .
My mother , M@@ ai , was 18 when her father died -- already in an ar@@ r@@ ang@@ ed marriage , already with two small girls .
For her , life had disti@@ l@@ led itself into one task : the es@@ cap@@ e of her family and a new life in Australia .
It was in@@ con@@ c@@ ei@@ v@@ able to her that she would not succe@@ ed .
So after a four@@ -@@ year sa@@ ga that de@@ fi@@ es fiction , a boat sli@@ pped out to sea dis@@ gu@@ is@@ ed as a fi@@ shing ves@@ se@@ l .
All the adults knew the risks .
The greatest fear was of p@@ ir@@ ates , rap@@ e and death .
Like most adults on the boat , my mother car@@ ried a small bot@@ tle of po@@ ison .
If we were cap@@ tured , first my sister and I , then she and my grandmother would drink .
My first memories are from the boat -- the stea@@ dy beat of the engine , the bo@@ w di@@ pping into each wave , the vast and empty h@@ ori@@ zon .
I don &apos;t remember the p@@ ir@@ ates who came many times , but were blu@@ ff@@ ed by the bra@@ va@@ do of the men on our boat , or the engine dying and fail@@ ing to start for six hours .
But I do remember the lights on the oil ri@@ g off the Mal@@ a@@ ysi@@ an co@@ ast and the young man who collap@@ sed and died , the journey &apos;s end too much for him , and the first app@@ le I ta@@ sted , given to me by the men on the ri@@ g .
No app@@ le has ever ta@@ sted the same .
After three months in a refuge@@ e camp , we lan@@ ded in Mel@@ b@@ our@@ ne .
And the next piece of the j@@ ig@@ saw is about four women across three generations shap@@ ing a new life together .
We sett@@ led in F@@ o@@ ot@@ scr@@ ay , a wor@@ ki@@ ng-@@ class su@@ bur@@ b whose demo@@ graphic is la@@ yers of im@@ migr@@ ants .
Un@@ like the sett@@ led mi@@ dd@@ le-@@ class su@@ bur@@ bs , whose exist@@ ence I was ob@@ li@@ vi@@ ous of , there was no sense of enti@@ t@@ le@@ ment in F@@ o@@ ot@@ scr@@ ay .
The smel@@ ls from shop do@@ ors were from the rest of the world .
And the s@@ ni@@ p@@ pe@@ ts of hal@@ ting English were ex@@ changed between people who had one thing in common , they were starting again .
My mother worked on f@@ arms , then on a car assem@@ bly line , working six days , double shif@@ ts .
Some@@ how she found time to study English and gain IT qu@@ ali@@ fi@@ cations .
We were poor .
All the dollars were allo@@ c@@ ated and extra tu@@ ition in English and mathematics was bud@@ ge@@ ted for re@@ gar@@ d@@ less of what mis@@ sed out , which was usually new clo@@ the@@ s ; they were always secon@@ d@@ hand .
Two pa@@ irs of st@@ oc@@ ki@@ ngs for school , each to hi@@ de the holes in the other .
A school uni@@ form down to the an@@ k@@ les , because it had to last for six years .
And there were rare but sear@@ ing chan@@ ts of &quot; sli@@ t-@@ eye &quot; and the occa@@ sional gra@@ ff@@ iti : &quot; A@@ sian , go home . &quot;
Go home to where ?
Some@@ thing sti@@ ff@@ ened inside me .
There was a gather@@ ing of re@@ solve and a qui@@ et voice saying , &quot; I will b@@ yp@@ ass you . &quot;
My mother , my sister and I sle@@ p@@ t in the same bed .
My mother was ex@@ ha@@ u@@ sted each night , but we told one another about our day and list@@ ened to the mo@@ vements of my grandmother around the house .
My mother suffer@@ ed from ni@@ ght@@ mar@@ es all about the boat .
And my job was to stay a@@ wake until her ni@@ ght@@ mar@@ es came so I could wake her .
She opened a computer store then studied to be a beauti@@ cian and opened another business .
And the women came with their stories about men who could not make the transi@@ tion , an@@ gr@@ y and inf@@ le@@ xi@@ ble , and trou@@ bled children caught between two worl@@ ds .
G@@ ran@@ ts and sp@@ on@@ s@@ ors were s@@ ought .
Cen@@ ters were estab@@ li@@ shed .
I lived in par@@ alle@@ l worl@@ ds .
In one , I was the classi@@ c A@@ sian student , re@@ l@@ ent@@ less in the dem@@ ands that I made on myself .
In the other , I was en@@ mes@@ h@@ ed in lives that were pre@@ car@@ i@@ ous , tra@@ gi@@ cally scar@@ red by violence , drug ab@@ use and isol@@ ation .
But so many over the years were helped .
And for that work , when I was a final year law student , I was ch@@ os@@ en as the young Austr@@ ali@@ an of the year .
And I was cat@@ ap@@ ul@@ ted from one piece of the j@@ ig@@ saw to another , and their ed@@ ges didn &apos;t fit .
T@@ an L@@ e , an@@ onym@@ ous F@@ o@@ ot@@ scr@@ ay resident , was now T@@ an L@@ e , refuge@@ e and social activi@@ st , invited to speak in ven@@ u@@ es she had never heard of and into homes whose exist@@ ence she could never have imag@@ ined .
I didn &apos;t know the prot@@ o@@ col@@ s .
I didn &apos;t know how to use the cu@@ t@@ l@@ ery .
I didn &apos;t know how to talk about wine .
I didn &apos;t know how to talk about anything .
I wanted to re@@ treat to the rou@@ ti@@ n@@ es and comfor@@ t of life in an un@@ sung su@@ bur@@ b -- a grandmother , a mother and two dau@@ gh@@ ters ending each day as they had for almost 20 years , telling one another the story of their day and falling as@@ le@@ ep , the three of us still in the same bed .
I told my mother I couldn &apos;t do it .
She remin@@ ded me that I was now the same age she had been when we bo@@ ar@@ ded the boat .
No had never been an op@@ tion .
&quot; Just do it , &quot; she said , &quot; and don &apos;t be what you &apos;re not . &quot;
So I spoke out on you@@ th une@@ mp@@ loy@@ ment and education and the ne@@ gl@@ ect of the mar@@ gin@@ alized and the dis@@ en@@ fran@@ ch@@ is@@ ed .
And the more can@@ di@@ dly I spoke , the more I was asked to speak .
I met people from all wal@@ ks of life , so many of them doing the thing they loved , living on the fron@@ ti@@ ers of possibility .
And even though I finished my degree , I realized I could not se@@ ttle into a career in law .
There had to be another piece of the j@@ ig@@ saw .
And I realized at the same time that it is okay to be an out@@ si@@ der , a recent arri@@ val , new on the scene -- and not just okay , but something to be th@@ an@@ k@@ ful for , perhaps a gift from the boat .
Because being an insi@@ der can so easily mean collap@@ sing the h@@ ori@@ z@@ ons , can so easily mean accep@@ ting the pre@@ sump@@ tions of your pro@@ v@@ ince .
I have st@@ ep@@ ped outside my comfor@@ t z@@ one enough now to know that , yes , the world does fall apart , but not in the way that you fear .
P@@ os@@ sibilities that would not have been allowed were ou@@ tr@@ ag@@ e@@ ously encoura@@ ged .
There was an energy there , an imp@@ l@@ ac@@ able opti@@ mis@@ m , a strange mi@@ x@@ ture of hu@@ mi@@ lity and dar@@ ing .
So I followed my hun@@ ches .
I gather@@ ed around me a small team of people for whom the lab@@ el &quot; It can &apos;t be done &quot; was an ir@@ resi@@ sti@@ ble challenge .
For a year we were pen@@ n@@ il@@ ess .
At the end of each day , I made a huge po@@ t of sou@@ p which we all shared .
We worked well into each night .
Most of our ideas were crazy , but a few were brilliant , and we bro@@ ke through .
I made the decision to move to the U.S.
after only one trip .
My hun@@ ches again .
Three months later I had re@@ lo@@ c@@ ated , and the ad@@ ven@@ ture has continu@@ ed .
Be@@ fore I close though , let me tell you about my grandmother .
She grew up at a time when Con@@ fu@@ ci@@ an@@ ism was the social nor@@ m and the local Mand@@ ar@@ in was the person who mat@@ tered .
Life hadn &apos;t changed for cen@@ tu@@ ries .
H@@ er father died soon after she was born .
H@@ er mother raised her alone .
At 17 she became the second wife of a Mand@@ ar@@ in whose mother beat her .
With no support from her husband , she caused a sen@@ sa@@ tion by taking him to cour@@ t and pros@@ ecu@@ ting her own case , and a far greater sen@@ sa@@ tion when she won .
&quot; It can &apos;t be done &quot; was shown to be wrong .
I was taking a sho@@ wer in a hot@@ el room in Sy@@ d@@ ney the moment she died 600 miles away in Mel@@ b@@ our@@ ne .
I looked through the sho@@ wer screen and saw her standing on the other side .
I knew she had come to say go@@ od@@ by@@ e .
My mother ph@@ oned minutes later .
A few days later , we went to a Bu@@ dd@@ hi@@ st temp@@ le in F@@ o@@ ot@@ scr@@ ay and sat around her cas@@ ket .
We told her stories and as@@ su@@ red her that we were still with her .
At mid@@ night the mon@@ k came and told us he had to close the cas@@ ket .
My mother asked us to feel her hand .
She asked the mon@@ k , &quot; Why is it that her hand is so war@@ m and the rest of her is so cold ? &quot;
&quot; Because you have been holding it since this morning , &quot; he said .
&quot; You have not let it go . &quot;
If there is a s@@ in@@ ew in our family , it runs through the women .
Gi@@ ven who we were and how life had shap@@ ed us , we can now see that the men who might have come into our lives would have th@@ war@@ ted us .
De@@ fe@@ at would have come too easily .
Now I would like to have my own children , and I wonder about the boat .
Who could ever wish it on their own ?
Yet I am afraid of privi@@ lege , of e@@ ase , of enti@@ t@@ le@@ ment .
Can I give them a bo@@ w in their lives , di@@ pping bra@@ vely into each wave , the un@@ per@@ tur@@ bed and stea@@ dy beat of the engine , the vast h@@ ori@@ zon that gu@@ ar@@ an@@ te@@ es nothing ?
I don &apos;t know .
But if I could give it and still see them safe@@ ly through , I would .
And also , T@@ an &apos;s mother is here today in the fourth or fi@@ f@@ th row .
Well this is a really extraordinary honor for me .
I spend most of my time in ja@@ ils , in pri@@ sons , on death row .
I spend most of my time in very low-@@ income communities in the projects and places where there &apos;s a great deal of ho@@ pel@@ ess@@ ness .
And being here at TED and seeing the sti@@ mulation , hearing it , has been very , very ener@@ gi@@ zing to me .
And one of the things that &apos;s emer@@ ged in my short time here is that TED has an identity .
And you can actually say things here that have imp@@ acts around the world .
And sometimes when it comes through TED , it has meaning and power that it doesn &apos;t have when it doesn &apos;t .
And I mention that because I think identity is really important .
And we &apos;ve had some fantastic presen@@ tations .
And I think what we &apos;ve learned is that , if you &apos;re a teacher your words can be meaning@@ ful , but if you &apos;re a compas@@ sionate teacher , they can be especially meaning@@ ful .
If you &apos;re a doctor you can do some good things , but if you &apos;re a car@@ ing doctor you can do some other things .
And so I want to talk about the power of identity .
And I didn &apos;t learn about this actually practic@@ ing law and doing the work that I do .
I actually learned about this from my grandmother .
I grew up in a house that was the traditional Afri@@ can@@ -@@ American home that was domin@@ ated by a ma@@ tri@@ ar@@ ch , and that ma@@ tri@@ ar@@ ch was my grandmother .
She was tough , she was strong , she was powerful .
She was the end of every argument in our family .
She was the beginning of a lot of arg@@ uments in our family .
She was the daughter of people who were actually en@@ sla@@ ved .
H@@ er parents were born in sla@@ very in Vir@@ gin@@ ia in the 18@@ 40 &apos;s .
She was born in the 18@@ 80 &apos;s and the experience of sla@@ very very much shap@@ ed the way she saw the world .
And my grandmother was tough , but she was also lo@@ ving .
When I would see her as a little boy , she &apos;d come up to me and she &apos;d give me these hu@@ gs .
And she &apos;d squ@@ e@@ e@@ ze me so ti@@ ght I could bar@@ ely brea@@ the and then she &apos;d let me go .
And an hour or two later , if I saw her , she &apos;d come over to me and she &apos;d say , &quot; Br@@ yan , do you still feel me hu@@ gging you ? &quot;
And if I said , &quot; No , &quot; she &apos;d as@@ sa@@ ul@@ t me again , and if I said , &quot; Yes , &quot; she &apos;d leave me alone .
And she just had this quality that you always wanted to be near her .
And the only challenge was that she had 10 children .
My mom was the you@@ ng@@ est of her 10 kids .
And sometimes when I would go and spend time with her , it would be difficult to get her time and attention .
My cou@@ s@@ ins would be running around everywhere .
And I remember , when I was about eight or nine years old , wa@@ king up one morning , going into the living room , and all of my cou@@ s@@ ins were running around .
And my grandmother was sitting across the room star@@ ing at me .
And at first I thought we were playing a game .
And I would look at her and I &apos;d s@@ mile , but she was very serious .
And after about 15 or 20 minutes of this , she got up and she came across the room and she took me by the hand and she said , &quot; Come on , Br@@ yan . You and I are going to have a talk . &quot;
And I remember this just like it happened y@@ esterday .
I never will forget it .
She took me out back and she said , &quot; Br@@ yan , I &apos;m going to tell you something , but you don &apos;t tell anybody what I tell you . &quot;
I said , &quot; Okay , M@@ ama . &quot;
She said , &quot; Now you make sure you don &apos;t do that . &quot; I said , &quot; S@@ ure . &quot;
Then she sat me down and she looked at me and she said , &quot; I want you to know I &apos;ve been watching you . &quot;
And she said , &quot; I think you &apos;re special . &quot;
She said , &quot; I think you can do anything you want to do . &quot;
I will never forget it .
And then she said , &quot; I just need you to promise me three things , Br@@ yan . &quot;
I said , &quot; Okay , M@@ ama . &quot;
She said , &quot; The first thing I want you to promise me is that you &apos;ll always love your mom . &quot;
She said , &quot; That &apos;s my baby girl , and you have to promise me now you &apos;ll always take care of her . &quot;
Well I a@@ do@@ red my mom , so I said , &quot; Yes , M@@ ama . I &apos;ll do that . &quot;
Then she said , &quot; The second thing I want you to promise me is that you &apos;ll always do the right thing even when the right thing is the hard thing . &quot;
And I thought about it and I said , &quot; Yes , M@@ ama . I &apos;ll do that . &quot;
Then finally she said , &quot; The third thing I want you to promise me is that you &apos;ll never drink al@@ co@@ ho@@ l . &quot;
Well I was nine years old , so I said , &quot; Yes , M@@ ama . I &apos;ll do that . &quot;
I grew up in the country in the rural South , and I have a brother a year older than me and a sister a year you@@ nger .
When I was about 14 or 15 , one day my brother came home and he had this six@@ -@@ p@@ ack of be@@ er -- I don &apos;t know where he got it -- and he gr@@ ab@@ bed me and my sister and we went out in the woo@@ ds .
And we were kind of just out there doing the stuff we cra@@ z@@ ily did .
And he had a si@@ p of this be@@ er and he gave some to my sister and she had some , and they offer@@ ed it to me .
I said , &quot; No , no , no . That &apos;s okay . You all go ahead . I &apos;m not going to have any be@@ er . &quot;
My brother said , &quot; Come on . We &apos;re doing this today ; you always do what we do .
I had some , your sister had some . Have some be@@ er . &quot;
I said , &quot; No , I don &apos;t feel right about that . Y &apos;@@ all go ahead . Y &apos;@@ all go ahead . &quot;
And then my brother started star@@ ing at me .
He said , &quot; What &apos;s wrong with you ? Have some be@@ er . &quot;
Then he looked at me real hard and he said , &quot; Oh , I hope you &apos;re not still hung up on that conversation M@@ ama had with you . &quot;
I said , &quot; Well , what are you talking about ? &quot;
He said , &quot; Oh , M@@ ama tells all the grand@@ kids that they &apos;re special . &quot;
I was de@@ va@@ st@@ ated .
And I &apos;m going to ad@@ mit something to you .
I &apos;m going to tell you something I probably shouldn &apos;t .
I know this might be broad@@ c@@ ast broad@@ ly .
But I &apos;m 5@@ 2 years old , and I &apos;m going to ad@@ mit to you that I &apos;ve never had a drop of al@@ co@@ ho@@ l .
I don &apos;t say that because I think that &apos;s vir@@ tu@@ ous ; I say that because there is power in identity .
When we create the right kind of identity , we can say things to the world around us that they don &apos;t actually believe makes sense .
We can get them to do things that they don &apos;t think they can do .
When I thought about my grandmother , of course she would think all her grand@@ kids were special .
My grandfather was in prison during pro@@ hi@@ bi@@ tion .
My male un@@ cles died of al@@ co@@ ho@@ l-@@ related diseases .
And these were the things she thought we needed to comm@@ it to .
Well I &apos;ve been trying to say something about our crimin@@ al justice system .
This country is very different today than it was 40 years ago .
In 197@@ 2 , there were 3@@ 0@@ 0,000 people in ja@@ ils and pri@@ sons .
Today , there are 2.@@ 3 million .
The United States now has the highest rate of in@@ car@@ cer@@ ation in the world .
We have seven million people on prob@@ ation and par@@ ole .
And mass in@@ car@@ cer@@ ation , in my jud@@ gment , has fundamen@@ tally changed our world .
In poor communities , in communities of color there is this des@@ pair , there is this ho@@ pel@@ ess@@ ness , that is being shap@@ ed by these out@@ comes .
One out of three black men between the ages of 18 and 30 is in ja@@ il , in prison , on prob@@ ation or par@@ ole .
In urban communities across this country -- Los Angeles , Ph@@ il@@ ad@@ el@@ ph@@ ia , Bal@@ ti@@ more , Washington -- 50 to 60 percent of all young men of color are in ja@@ il or prison or on prob@@ ation or par@@ ole .
Our system isn &apos;t just being shap@@ ed in these ways that seem to be di@@ stor@@ ting around race , they &apos;re also di@@ stor@@ ted by poverty .
We have a system of justice in this country that tre@@ ats you much better if you &apos;re rich and gu@@ il@@ ty than if you &apos;re poor and inno@@ cent .
We@@ al@@ th , not culp@@ ability , shapes out@@ comes .
And yet , we seem to be very comfortable .
The politics of fear and anger have made us believe that these are problems that are not our problems .
We &apos;ve been dis@@ connected .
It &apos;s interesting to me .
We &apos;re looking at some very interesting develop@@ ments in our work .
My state of Al@@ ab@@ ama , like a number of states , actually per@@ man@@ ently dis@@ en@@ fran@@ ch@@ is@@ es you if you have a crimin@@ al con@@ vi@@ ction .
Right now in Al@@ ab@@ ama 3@@ 4 percent of the black male population has per@@ man@@ ently lost the right to vote .
We &apos;re actually pro@@ j@@ ecting in another 10 years the level of dis@@ en@@ fran@@ chi@@ se@@ ment will be as high as it &apos;s been since pri@@ or to the pas@@ sa@@ ge of the Vo@@ ting Ri@@ ghts Ac@@ t .
And there is this st@@ un@@ ning silence .
I represent children .
A lot of my cli@@ ents are very young .
The United States is the only country in the world where we sentence 1@@ 3@@ -year-old children to die in prison .
We have life imp@@ ri@@ son@@ ment without par@@ ole for kids in this country .
And we &apos;re actually doing some li@@ ti@@ gation .
The only country in the world .
I represent people on death row .
It &apos;s interesting , this question of the death pen@@ al@@ ty .
In many ways , we &apos;ve been taught to think that the real question is , do people deser@@ ve to die for the cri@@ mes they &apos;ve commit@@ ted ?
And that &apos;s a very sen@@ sible question .
But there &apos;s another way of thinking about where we are in our identity .
The other way of thinking about it is not , do people deser@@ ve to die for the cri@@ mes they comm@@ it , but do we deser@@ ve to kill ?
I mean , it &apos;s fascinating .
De@@ ath pen@@ al@@ ty in America is defined by error .
For every nine people who have been ex@@ ecu@@ ted , we &apos;ve actually identi@@ fied one inno@@ cent person who &apos;s been ex@@ on@@ er@@ ated and released from death row .
A kind of ast@@ oni@@ shing error rate -- one out of nine people inno@@ cent .
I mean , it &apos;s fascinating .
In a@@ vi@@ ation , we would never let people fly on air@@ plan@@ es if for every nine plan@@ es that took off one would cr@@ ash .
But somehow we can insul@@ ate ourselves from this problem .
It &apos;s not our problem .
It &apos;s not our bur@@ den .
It &apos;s not our struggle .
I talk a lot about these issues .
I talk about race and this question of whether we deser@@ ve to kill .
And it &apos;s interesting , when I teach my students about Afri@@ can@@ -@@ American history , I tell them about sla@@ very .
I tell them about terr@@ or@@ ism , the era that began at the end of re@@ construction that went on to World War II .
We don &apos;t really know very much about it .
But for Afri@@ can@@ -@@ Americans in this country , that was an era defined by ter@@ ror .
In many communities , people had to worry about being ly@@ n@@ ched .
They had to worry about being bom@@ bed .
It was the threat of ter@@ ror that shap@@ ed their lives .
And these older people come up to me now and they say , &quot; Mr. Ste@@ ven@@ son , you give talks , you make spe@@ e@@ ches , you tell people to stop saying we &apos;re de@@ aling with terr@@ or@@ ism for the first time in our nation &apos;s history after 9 / 11 . &quot;
They tell me to say , &quot; No , tell them that we grew up with that . &quot;
And that era of terr@@ or@@ ism , of course , was followed by se@@ gre@@ gation and decades of rac@@ ial su@@ bor@@ din@@ ation and ap@@ ar@@ the@@ id .
And yet , we have in this country this dynamic where we really don &apos;t like to talk about our problems .
We don &apos;t like to talk about our history .
And because of that , we really haven &apos;t understood what it &apos;s meant to do the things we &apos;ve done histor@@ ically .
We &apos;re constantly running into each other .
We &apos;re constantly creating ten@@ sions and conflic@@ ts .
We have a hard time talking about race , and I believe it &apos;s because we are un@@ willing to comm@@ it ourselves to a process of truth and re@@ con@@ ci@@ li@@ ation .
In South Africa , people understood that we couldn &apos;t over@@ come ap@@ ar@@ the@@ id without a commit@@ ment to truth and re@@ con@@ ci@@ li@@ ation .
In Rwanda , even after the gen@@ o@@ ci@@ de , there was this commit@@ ment , but in this country we haven &apos;t done that .
I was giving some lec@@ tures in Germany about the death pen@@ al@@ ty .
It was fascinating because one of the sch@@ ol@@ ars stood up after the presen@@ tation and said , &quot; Well you know it &apos;s deeply trou@@ bling to hear what you &apos;re talking about . &quot;
He said , &quot; We don &apos;t have the death pen@@ al@@ ty in Germany .
And of course , we can never have the death pen@@ al@@ ty in Germany . &quot;
And the room got very qui@@ et , and this woman said , &quot; There &apos;s no way , with our history , we could ever engage in the syst@@ ema@@ tic killing of human beings .
It would be un@@ consci@@ on@@ able for us to , in an inten@@ tional and deli@@ ber@@ ate way , set about ex@@ ecu@@ ting people . &quot;
And I thought about that .
What would it feel like to be living in a world where the nation state of Germany was ex@@ ecu@@ ting people , especially if they were dis@@ pro@@ por@@ tion@@ ately Je@@ wish ?
I couldn &apos;t bear it .
It would be un@@ consci@@ on@@ able .
And yet , in this country , in the states of the O@@ ld South , we ex@@ ecu@@ te people -- where you &apos;re 11 times more likely to get the death pen@@ al@@ ty if the vic@@ tim is white than if the vic@@ tim is black , 22 times more likely to get it if the def@@ end@@ ant is black and the vic@@ tim is white -- in the very states where there are bu@@ ried in the ground the bodies of people who were ly@@ n@@ ched .
And yet , there is this dis@@ connect .
Well I believe that our identity is at risk .
That when we actually don &apos;t care about these difficult things , the positive and wonderful things are non@@ e@@ the@@ less imp@@ licated .
We love innovation .
We love technology . We love creativity .
We love enter@@ tainment .
But ultimately , those reali@@ ties are sha@@ do@@ wed by suffering , ab@@ use , de@@ gra@@ d@@ ation , mar@@ gin@@ alization .
And for me , it becomes necessary to integr@@ ate the two .
Because ultimately we are talking about a need to be more hope@@ ful , more commit@@ ted , more de@@ dic@@ ated to the basic challenges of living in a complex world .
And for me that means spending time thinking and talking about the poor , the disa@@ d@@ v@@ ant@@ aged , those who will never get to TED .
But thinking about them in a way that is integr@@ ated in our own lives .
You know ultimately , we all have to believe things we haven &apos;t seen .
We do . As rational as we are , as commit@@ ted to intel@@ l@@ ect as we are .
In@@ no@@ vation , creativity , development comes not from the ideas in our mind alone .
They come from the ideas in our mind that are also fu@@ el@@ ed by some con@@ vi@@ ction in our heart .
And it &apos;s that min@@ d-@@ heart connection that I believe comp@@ els us to not just be atten@@ tive to all the bright and da@@ zz@@ ly things , but also the dark and difficult things .
V@@ ac@@ la@@ v Ha@@ vel , the great C@@ z@@ ech leader , talked about this .
He said , &quot; When we were in E@@ a@@ stern Europe and de@@ aling with op@@ pres@@ sion , we wanted all kinds of things , but mostly what we needed was hope , an ori@@ en@@ tation of the spirit , a w@@ illi@@ ng@@ ness to sometimes be in ho@@ p@@ eless places and be a wit@@ ness . &quot;
Well that ori@@ en@@ tation of the spirit is very much at the core of what I believe even TED communities have to be engaged in .
There is no dis@@ connect around technology and design that will allow us to be fully human until we pay attention to suffering , to poverty , to ex@@ cl@@ usion , to un@@ fair@@ ness , to in@@ justice .
Now I will war@@ n you that this kind of identity is a much more challeng@@ ing identity than ones that don &apos;t pay attention to this .
It will get to you .
I had the great privi@@ lege , when I was a young law@@ yer , of meeting Ros@@ a Par@@ ks .
And M@@ s@@ . Par@@ ks used to come back to Mon@@ t@@ g@@ om@@ ery every now and then , and she would get together with two of her de@@ ar@@ est friends , these older women , John@@ ni@@ e Car@@ r who was the organi@@ z@@ er of the Mon@@ t@@ g@@ om@@ ery bus bo@@ y@@ cot@@ t -- amazing Afri@@ can@@ -@@ American woman -- and Vir@@ gin@@ ia D@@ ur@@ r , a white woman , whose husband , C@@ lif@@ ford D@@ ur@@ r , represen@@ ted Dr. King .
And these women would get together and just talk .
And every now and then M@@ s@@ . Car@@ r would call me , and she &apos;d say , &quot; Br@@ yan , M@@ s@@ . Par@@ ks is coming to town . We &apos;re going to get together and talk .
Do you want to come over and listen ? &quot;
And I &apos;d say , &quot; Yes , M@@ a &apos;@@ am , I do . &quot;
And she &apos;d say , &quot; Well what are you going to do when you get here ? &quot;
I said , &quot; I &apos;m going to listen . &quot;
And I &apos;d go over there and I would , I would just listen .
It would be so ener@@ gi@@ zing and so empo@@ wering .
And one time I was over there listening to these women talk , and after a couple of hours M@@ s@@ . Par@@ ks turned to me and she said , &quot; Now Br@@ yan , tell me what the E@@ qu@@ al J@@ us@@ tice I@@ ni@@ ti@@ ative is .
T@@ ell me what you &apos;re trying to do . &quot;
And I began giving her my ra@@ p .
I said , &quot; Well we &apos;re trying to challenge in@@ justice .
We &apos;re trying to help people who have been w@@ ro@@ ngly con@@ vic@@ ted .
We &apos;re trying to conf@@ ron@@ t bi@@ as and dis@@ crimin@@ ation in the ad@@ mini@@ str@@ ation of crimin@@ al justice .
We &apos;re trying to end life without par@@ ole sen@@ ten@@ ces for children .
We &apos;re trying to do something about the death pen@@ al@@ ty .
We &apos;re trying to reduce the prison population .
We &apos;re trying to end mass in@@ car@@ cer@@ ation . &quot;
I gave her my whole ra@@ p , and when I finished she looked at me and she said , &quot; M@@ mm mm@@ m mm@@ m . &quot;
She said , &quot; That &apos;s going to make you ti@@ red , ti@@ red , ti@@ red . &quot;
And that &apos;s when M@@ s@@ . Car@@ r le@@ an@@ ed forward , she put her fi@@ nger in my face , she said , &quot; That &apos;s why you &apos;ve got to be bra@@ ve , bra@@ ve , bra@@ ve . &quot;
And I actually believe that the TED community needs to be more coura@@ ge@@ ous .
We need to find ways to embr@@ ace these challenges , these problems , the suffering .
Because ultimately , our humanity depends on everyone &apos;s humanity .
I &apos;ve learned very simple things doing the work that I do .
It &apos;s just taught me very simple things .
I &apos;ve come to understand and to believe that each of us is more than the worst thing we &apos;ve ever done .
I believe that for every person on the planet .
I think if somebody tells a lie , they &apos;re not just a liar .
I think if somebody takes something that doesn &apos;t bel@@ ong to them , they &apos;re not just a thi@@ ef .
I think even if you kill someone , you &apos;re not just a k@@ iller .
And because of that there &apos;s this basic human dig@@ nity that must be resp@@ ected by law .
I also believe that in many parts of this country , and certainly in many parts of this glo@@ be , that the opposite of poverty is not wealth .
I don &apos;t believe that .
I actually think , in too many places , the opposite of poverty is justice .
And finally , I believe that , despite the fact that it is so dramatic and so beautiful and so in@@ spir@@ ing and so sti@@ mu@@ lating , we will ultimately not be jud@@ ged by our technology , we won &apos;t be jud@@ ged by our design , we won &apos;t be jud@@ ged by our intel@@ l@@ ect and reason .
U@@ l@@ timately , you ju@@ dge the character of a society , not by how they treat their rich and the powerful and the privi@@ leg@@ ed , but by how they treat the poor , the con@@ dem@@ ned , the in@@ car@@ cer@@ ated .
Because it &apos;s in that nex@@ us that we actually begin to understand truly profound things about who we are .
I sometimes get out of balance . I &apos;ll end with this story .
I sometimes push too hard .
I do get ti@@ red , as we all do .
Sometimes those ideas get ahead of our thinking in ways that are important .
And I &apos;ve been represen@@ ting these kids who have been sen@@ ten@@ ced to do these very har@@ sh sen@@ ten@@ ces .
And I go to the ja@@ il and I see my cli@@ ent who &apos;s 13 and 14 , and he &apos;s been cer@@ ti@@ fied to stand trial as an adult .
I start thinking , well , how did that happen ?
How can a ju@@ dge turn you into something that you &apos;re not ?
And the ju@@ dge has cer@@ ti@@ fied him as an adult , but I see this kid .
And I was up too late one night and I starting thinking , well g@@ os@@ h , if the ju@@ dge can turn you into something that you &apos;re not , the ju@@ dge must have magic power .
Yeah , Br@@ yan , the ju@@ dge has some magic power .
You should ask for some of that .
And because I was up too late , wasn &apos;t thinking real straight , I started working on a motion .
And I had a cli@@ ent who was 14 years old , a young , poor black kid .
And I started working on this motion , and the head of the motion was : &quot; Mo@@ tion to try my poor , 14@@ -year-old black male cli@@ ent like a privi@@ leg@@ ed , white 7@@ 5@@ -year-old corpor@@ ate ex@@ ecu@@ tive . &quot;
And I put in my motion that there was pros@@ ecu@@ t@@ ori@@ al mis@@ conduc@@ t and police mis@@ conduc@@ t and ju@@ di@@ cial mis@@ conduc@@ t .
There was a crazy line in there about how there &apos;s no conduc@@ t in this coun@@ ty , it &apos;s all mis@@ conduc@@ t .
And the next morning , I wo@@ ke up and I thought , now did I dream that crazy motion , or did I actually write it ?
And to my hor@@ ror , not only had I written it , but I had sent it to cour@@ t .
A couple months went by , and I had just for@@ gotten all about it .
And I finally decided , oh g@@ os@@ h , I &apos;ve got to go to the cour@@ t and do this crazy case .
And I got into my car and I was feeling really overwhel@@ med -- overwhel@@ med .
And I got in my car and I went to this cour@@ thou@@ se .
And I was thinking , this is going to be so difficult , so pain@@ ful .
And I finally got out of the car and I started walking up to the cour@@ thou@@ se .
And as I was walking up the steps of this cour@@ thou@@ se , there was an older black man who was the j@@ an@@ it@@ or in this cour@@ thou@@ se .
When this man saw me , he came over to me and he said , &quot; Who are you ? &quot;
I said , &quot; I &apos;m a law@@ yer . &quot; He said , &quot; You &apos;re a law@@ yer ? &quot; I said , &quot; Yes , si@@ r . &quot;
And this man came over to me and he hu@@ gged me .
And he whi@@ s@@ per@@ ed in my ear .
He said , &quot; I &apos;m so proud of you . &quot;
And I have to tell you , it was ener@@ gi@@ zing .
It connected deeply with something in me about identity , about the capacity of every person to contribu@@ te to a community , to a perspective that is hope@@ ful .
Well I went into the cour@@ tro@@ om .
And as soon as I walked inside , the ju@@ dge saw me coming in .
He said , &quot; Mr. Ste@@ ven@@ son , did you write this crazy motion ? &quot;
I said , &quot; Yes , si@@ r . I did . &quot; And we started argu@@ ing .
And people started coming in because they were just ou@@ tr@@ aged .
I had written these crazy things .
and assi@@ stant pros@@ ecu@@ tors and cl@@ er@@ k workers .
And before I knew it , the cour@@ tro@@ om was filled with people an@@ gr@@ y that we were talking about race , that we were talking about poverty , that we were talking about ine@@ quality .
And out of the corner of my eye , I could see this j@@ an@@ it@@ or p@@ ac@@ ing back and forth .
And he kept looking through the window , and he could hear all of this hol@@ ler .
He kept p@@ ac@@ ing back and forth .
came into the cour@@ tro@@ om and sat down behind me , almost at coun@@ se@@ l table .
Ab@@ out 10 minutes later the ju@@ dge said we would take a break .
And during the break there was a de@@ pu@@ ty sh@@ eri@@ ff who was off@@ ended that the j@@ an@@ it@@ or had come into cour@@ t .
And this de@@ pu@@ ty jump@@ ed up and he ran over to this older black man .
He said , &quot; J@@ im@@ my , what are you doing in this cour@@ tro@@ om ? &quot;
And this older black man stood up and he looked at that de@@ pu@@ ty and he looked at me and he said , &quot; I came into this cour@@ tro@@ om to tell this young man , keep your eyes on the pri@@ ze , hold on . &quot;
I &apos;ve come to TED because I believe that many of you understand that the moral ar@@ c of the universe is long , but it b@@ ends toward justice .
That we cannot be full evolved human beings until we care about human rights and basic dig@@ nity .
That all of our survival is ti@@ ed to the survival of everyone .
That our vi@@ sions of technology and design and enter@@ tainment and creativity have to be married with vi@@ sions of humanity , compassion and justice .
And more than anything , for those of you who share that , I &apos;ve simply come to tell you to keep your eyes on the pri@@ ze , hold on .
Thank you very much .
So you heard and saw an obvious desire by this audience , this community , to help you on your way and to do something on this issue .
O@@ ther than writing a check , what could we do ?
Well there are opportunities all around us .
If you live in the state of California , for example , there &apos;s a refer@@ en@@ du@@ m coming up this spring where actually there &apos;s going to be an effort to re@@ direct some of the money we spend on the politics of p@@ uni@@ sh@@ ment .
For example , here in California we &apos;re going to spend one billion dollars on the death pen@@ al@@ ty in the next five years -- one billion dollars .
And yet , 4@@ 6 percent of all hom@@ ici@@ de cases don &apos;t result in ar@@ rest .
5@@ 6 percent of all rap@@ e cases don &apos;t result .
So there &apos;s an opportunity to change that .
And this refer@@ en@@ du@@ m would pro@@ pose having those dollars go to law en@@ for@@ ce@@ ment and safety .
And I think that opportunity exists all around us .
There &apos;s been this huge dec@@ line in crime in America over the last three decades .
And part of the narrative of that is sometimes that it &apos;s about incre@@ ased in@@ car@@ cer@@ ation r@@ ates .
What would you say to someone who believed that ?
Well actually the violent crime rate has rema@@ ined relatively stable .
The great increase in mass in@@ car@@ cer@@ ation in this country wasn &apos;t really in violent crime categ@@ ories .
It was this mis@@ gui@@ ded war on drugs .
That &apos;s where the dramatic incre@@ ases have come in our prison population .
And we got car@@ ried away with the r@@ he@@ tor@@ ic of p@@ uni@@ sh@@ ment .
And so we have three stri@@ kes laws that put people in prison forever for ste@@ aling a b@@ ic@@ y@@ cle , for low-@@ level property cri@@ mes , rather than making them give those resources back to the people who they victi@@ mi@@ zed .
I believe we need to do more to help people who are victi@@ mi@@ zed by crime , not do less .
And I think our current p@@ uni@@ sh@@ ment philosoph@@ y does nothing for no one .
And I think that &apos;s the ori@@ en@@ tation that we have to change .
Br@@ yan , you &apos;ve stru@@ ck a massive ch@@ or@@ d here .
You &apos;re an in@@ spir@@ ing person .
Thank you so much for coming to TED . Thank you .
I &apos;m going to speak about a tiny , little idea .
And this is about shif@@ ting bas@@ el@@ ine .
And because the idea can be expla@@ ined in one minute , I will tell you three stories before to fill in the time .
And the first story is about Charles Darwin , one of my her@@ oes .
And he was here , as you well know , in &apos; 35 .
And you &apos;d think he was ch@@ asing fin@@ ches , but he wasn &apos;t .
He was actually coll@@ ecting fish .
And he described one of them as very &quot; common . &quot;
This was the sa@@ il@@ f@@ in grou@@ per .
A big fi@@ sh@@ ery was run on it until the &apos; 8@@ 0s .
Now the fish is on the I@@ U@@ C@@ N R@@ ed Li@@ st .
Now this story , we have heard it lots of times on Gal@@ ap@@ a@@ gos and other places , so there is nothing particular about it .
But the point is , we still come to Gal@@ ap@@ a@@ gos .
We still think it is pri@@ sti@@ ne .
The bro@@ chu@@ res still say it is un@@ tou@@ ched .
So what happens here ?
The second story , also to illustr@@ ate another concept , is called shif@@ ting wai@@ st@@ line .
Because I was there in &apos; 7@@ 1 , studying a la@@ go@@ on in West Africa .
I was there because I grew up in Europe and I wanted later to work in Africa .
And I thought I could bl@@ end in .
And I got a big sun@@ burn , and I was convinced that I was really not from there .
This was my first sun@@ burn .
And the la@@ go@@ on was surroun@@ ded by pal@@ m trees , as you can see , and a few man@@ gro@@ ve .
And it had ti@@ lap@@ ia about 20 c@@ enti@@ meters , a species of ti@@ lap@@ ia called bl@@ ack@@ ch@@ in ti@@ lap@@ ia .
And the fi@@ sh@@ er@@ ies for this ti@@ lap@@ ia susta@@ ined lots of fish and they had a good time and they ear@@ ned more than average in Ghana .
When I went there 27 years later , the fish had sh@@ run@@ k to half of their size .
They were mat@@ uring at five c@@ enti@@ meters .
They had been push@@ ed gene@@ tically .
There were still fi@@ shes .
They were still kind of happy .
And the fish also were happy to be there .
So nothing has changed , but everything has changed .
My third little story is that I was an accomp@@ li@@ ce in the intro@@ duction of tra@@ w@@ ling in S@@ ou@@ the@@ ast Asia .
In the &apos; 7@@ 0s -- well , beginning in the &apos; 6@@ 0s -- Europe did lots of development projects .
F@@ ish development meant impos@@ ing on countries that had already 100,000 fi@@ sh@@ ers to imp@@ ose on them industrial fi@@ shing .
And this boat , quite ug@@ ly , is called the Mu@@ ti@@ ara 4 .
And I went sa@@ iling on it , and we did sur@@ ve@@ ys throughout the sou@@ thern South China sea and especially the Ja@@ va Se@@ a .
And what we caught , we didn &apos;t have words for it .
What we caught , I know now , is the bottom of the sea .
And 90 percent of our catch were spo@@ ng@@ es , other animals that are fi@@ xed on the bottom .
And actually most of the fish , they are a little spot on the de@@ br@@ is , the pil@@ es of de@@ br@@ is , were cor@@ al re@@ ef fish .
E@@ s@@ s@@ entially the bottom of the sea came onto the dec@@ k and then was thro@@ wn down .
And these pictures are extraordinary because this transi@@ tion is very rap@@ id .
Wi@@ thin a year , you do a sur@@ vey and then commercial fi@@ shing begins .
The bottom is trans@@ formed from , in this case , a hard bottom or so@@ ft cor@@ al into a mu@@ d@@ dy m@@ ess .
This is a dead tur@@ tle .
They were not e@@ at@@ en , they were thro@@ wn away because they were dead .
And one time we caught a live one .
It was not dro@@ w@@ ned yet .
And then they wanted to kill it because it was good to eat .
This mountain of de@@ br@@ is is actually coll@@ ected by fi@@ sh@@ ers every time they go into an area that &apos;s never been fi@@ shed .
But it &apos;s not docu@@ mented .
We transform the world , but we don &apos;t remember it .
We ad@@ just our bas@@ el@@ ine to the new level , and we don &apos;t rec@@ all what was there .
If you gener@@ alize this , something like this happens .
You have on the y ax@@ is some good thing : bio@@ diversity , numbers of or@@ ca , the gre@@ en@@ ness of your country , the water supply .
And over time it changes -- it changes because people do things , or nat@@ ur@@ ally .
Every generation will use the images that they got at the beginning of their conscious lives as a standard and will ex@@ tr@@ ap@@ ol@@ ate forward .
And the difference then , they percei@@ ve as a loss .
But they don &apos;t percei@@ ve what happened before as a loss .
You can have a suc@@ c@@ ession of changes .
At the end you want to susta@@ in mi@@ ser@@ able le@@ f@@ to@@ vers .
And that , to a large ex@@ tent , is what we want to do now .
We want to susta@@ in things that are gone or things that are not the way they were .
Now one should think this problem affected people certainly when in pre@@ d@@ atory societies , they killed animals and they didn &apos;t know they had done so after a few generations .
Because , obviously , an animal that is very ab@@ un@@ d@@ ant , before it gets exti@@ nct , it becomes rare .
So you don &apos;t lose ab@@ un@@ d@@ ant animals .
You always lose rare animals .
And therefore they &apos;re not percei@@ ved as a big loss .
Over time , we concentr@@ ate on large animals , and in a sea that means the big fish .
They become rar@@ er because we fish them .
Over time we have a few fish left and we think this is the bas@@ el@@ ine .
And the question is , why do people accept this ?
Well because they don &apos;t know that it was different .
And in fact , lots of people , scientists , will cont@@ est that it was really different .
And they will cont@@ est this because the evidence presen@@ ted in an earlier mo@@ de is not in the way they would like the evidence presen@@ ted .
For example , the an@@ ec@@ d@@ ote that some present , as Cap@@ tain so@@ -@@ and-@@ so obser@@ ved lots of fish in this area cannot be used or is usually not u@@ tili@@ zed by fi@@ sh@@ ery scientists , because it &apos;s not &quot; scientific . &quot;
So you have a situation where people don &apos;t know the past , even though we live in liter@@ ate societies , because they don &apos;t trust the sources of the past .
And h@@ ence , the enormous role that a mar@@ ine prot@@ ected area can play .
Because with mar@@ ine prot@@ ected areas , we actually re@@ create the past .
We re@@ create the past that people cannot con@@ c@@ ei@@ ve because the bas@@ el@@ ine has shif@@ ted and is extremely low .
That is for people who can see a mar@@ ine prot@@ ected area and who can benefit from the insi@@ ght that it provi@@ des , which en@@ ables them to re@@ set their bas@@ el@@ ine .
How about the people who can &apos;t do that because they have no access -- the people in the M@@ id@@ w@@ est for example ?
There I think that the arts and film can perhaps fill the gap , and si@@ mulation .
This is a si@@ mulation of Ch@@ es@@ ap@@ ea@@ ke B@@ ay .
There were gr@@ ay wh@@ ales in Ch@@ es@@ ap@@ ea@@ ke B@@ ay a long time ago -- 500 years ago .
And you will have noticed that the hu@@ es and t@@ ones are like &quot; A@@ v@@ at@@ ar . &quot;
And if you think about &quot; A@@ v@@ at@@ ar , &quot; if you think of why people were so tou@@ ched by it -- never mind the Po@@ ca@@ hon@@ t@@ as story -- why so tou@@ ched by the imag@@ ery ?
Because it ev@@ o@@ kes something that in a sense has been lost .
And so my re@@ com@@ mend@@ ation , it &apos;s the only one I will provide , is for Cam@@ er@@ on to do &quot; A@@ v@@ at@@ ar II &quot; under@@ water .
Thank you very much .
Do you know how many choices you make in a typical day ?
Do you know how many choices you make in typical week ?
I recently did a sur@@ vey with over 2,000 Americans , and the average number of choices that the typical American repor@@ ts making is about 70 in a typical day .
There was also recently a study done with CE@@ O@@ s in which they followed CE@@ O@@ s around for a whole week .
And these scientists simply docu@@ mented all the various t@@ asks that these CE@@ O@@ s engaged in and how much time they spent eng@@ aging in making decisions related to these t@@ asks .
And they found that the average CE@@ O engaged in about 1@@ 3@@ 9 t@@ asks in a week .
Each task was made up of many , many , many sub@@ -@@ choices of course .
50 percent of their decisions were made in nine minutes or less .
On@@ ly about 12 percent of the decisions did they make an hour or more of their time .
Think about your own choices .
Do you know how many choices make it into your nine minute categ@@ ory versus your one hour categ@@ ory ?
How well do you think you &apos;re doing at manag@@ ing those choices ?
Today I want to talk about one of the biggest modern day cho@@ os@@ ing problems that we have , which is the choice over@@ load problem .
I want to talk about the problem and some potential solutions .
Now as I talk about this problem , I &apos;m going to have some questions for you and I &apos;m going to want to know your answers .
So when I ask you a question , since I &apos;m blind , only raise your hand if you want to burn off some cal@@ ories .
O@@ therwise , when I ask you a question , and if your answer is yes , I &apos;d like you to cla@@ p your hands .
So for my first question for you today : Are you guys ready to hear about the choice over@@ load problem ?
Thank you .
So when I was a graduate student at Stanford University , I used to go to this very , very up@@ scale gro@@ cer@@ y store ; at least at that time it was truly up@@ scale .
It was a store called D@@ ra@@ e@@ ger &apos;s .
Now this store , it was almost like going to an am@@ us@@ ement park .
They had 250 different kinds of mu@@ star@@ ds and v@@ ine@@ gar@@ s and over 500 different kinds of fru@@ its and vege@@ tables and more than two do@@ zen different kinds of bot@@ t@@ led water -- and this was during a time when we actually used to drink ta@@ p water .
I used to love going to this store , but on one occa@@ sion I asked myself , well how come you never buy anything ?
Here &apos;s their o@@ live oil a@@ is@@ le .
They had over 75 different kinds of o@@ live oil , including those that were in a lo@@ cked case that came from thous@@ and@@ -year-old o@@ live trees .
So I one day decided to pay a visit to the manag@@ er , and I asked the manag@@ er , &quot; Is this model of offer@@ ing people all this choice really working ? &quot;
And he poin@@ ted to the bus@@ lo@@ ads of tou@@ ri@@ sts that would show up everyday , with camer@@ as ready usually .
We decided to do a little experiment , and we picked j@@ am for our experiment .
Here &apos;s their j@@ am a@@ is@@ le .
They had 3@@ 4@@ 8 different kinds of j@@ am .
We set up a little t@@ as@@ ting bo@@ oth right near the en@@ tr@@ ance of the store .
We there put out six different fla@@ v@@ ors of j@@ am or 24 different fla@@ v@@ ors of j@@ am , and we looked at two things : First , in which case were people more likely to stop , sample some j@@ am ?
More people stopped when there were 24 , about 60 percent , than when there were six , about 40 percent .
The next thing we looked at is in which case were people more likely to buy a j@@ ar of j@@ am .
Now we see the opposite effect .
Of the people who stopped when there were 24 , only three percent of them actually bought a j@@ ar of j@@ am .
Of the people who stopped when there were six , well now we saw that 30 percent of them actually bought a j@@ ar of j@@ am .
Now if you do the math , people were at least six times more likely to buy a j@@ ar of j@@ am if they encoun@@ tered six than if they encoun@@ tered 24 .
Now cho@@ os@@ ing not to buy a j@@ ar of j@@ am is probably good for us -- at least it &apos;s good for our wai@@ st@@ lines -- but it turns out that this choice over@@ load problem aff@@ ects us even in very consequ@@ ential decisions .
We choose not to choose , even when it goes against our best self-@@ interests .
So now for the topic of today : financial sa@@ vi@@ ngs .
Now I &apos;m going to describe to you a study I did with G@@ ur Hu@@ ber@@ man , E@@ mi@@ r K@@ am@@ en@@ ica , We@@ i J@@ ang where we looked at the reti@@ rement sa@@ vi@@ ngs decisions of nearly a million Americans from about 6@@ 50 pl@@ ans all in the U.S.
And what we looked at was whether the number of fu@@ nd offer@@ ings available in a reti@@ rement sa@@ vi@@ ngs plan , the 40@@ 1 plan , does that affect people &apos;s like@@ li@@ hood to save more for tomorrow .
And what we found was that indeed there was a cor@@ re@@ lation .
So in these pl@@ ans , we had about 6@@ 5@@ 7 pl@@ ans that r@@ ang@@ ed from offer@@ ing people anywhere from two to 5@@ 9 different fu@@ nd offer@@ ings .
And what we found was that , the more fun@@ ds offer@@ ed , indeed , there was less particip@@ ation rate .
So if you look at the extre@@ mes , those pl@@ ans that offer@@ ed you two fun@@ ds , particip@@ ation r@@ ates were around in the mi@@ d-@@ 7@@ 0s -- still not as high as we want it to be .
In those pl@@ ans that offer@@ ed nearly 60 fun@@ ds , particip@@ ation r@@ ates have now dro@@ pped to about the 6@@ 0@@ th perc@@ enti@@ le .
Now it turns out that even if you do choose to particip@@ ate when there are more choices present , even then , it has negative consequences .
So for those people who did choose to particip@@ ate , the more choices available , the more likely people were to completely avoid st@@ oc@@ ks or equ@@ ity fun@@ ds .
The more choices available , the more likely they were to put all their money in pu@@ re money market accoun@@ ts .
Now ne@@ i@@ ther of these extreme decisions are the kinds of decisions that any of us would re@@ comm@@ end for people when you &apos;re consi@@ dering their future financial well-@@ being .
Well , over the past decade , we have obser@@ ved three main negative consequences to offer@@ ing people more and more choices .
They &apos;re more likely to del@@ ay cho@@ os@@ ing -- pro@@ cr@@ as@@ ti@@ nate even when it goes against their best self-@@ interest .
They &apos;re more likely to make worse choices -- worse financial choices , medical choices .
They &apos;re more likely to choose things that make them less satis@@ fied , even when they do ob@@ jec@@ tively better .
The main reason for this is because , we might enjoy ga@@ zing at those giant walls of ma@@ y@@ on@@ na@@ is@@ es , mu@@ star@@ ds , v@@ ine@@ gar@@ s , j@@ ams , but we can &apos;t actually do the math of compar@@ ing and contr@@ as@@ ting and actually pic@@ king from that st@@ un@@ ning disp@@ lay .
So what I want to pro@@ pose to you today are four simple techniques -- techniques that we have te@@ sted in one way or another in different research ven@@ u@@ es -- that you can easily apply in your businesses .
The first : C@@ ut .
You &apos;ve heard it said before , but it &apos;s never been more true than today , that less is more .
People are always up@@ set when I say , &quot; C@@ ut . &quot;
They &apos;re always worried they &apos;re going to lose shel@@ f space .
But in fact , what we &apos;re seeing more and more is that if you are willing to cut , get rid of those ex@@ tran@@ e@@ ous re@@ d@@ un@@ d@@ ant op@@ tions , well there &apos;s an increase in sal@@ es , there &apos;s a lo@@ wering of costs , there is an impro@@ vement of the cho@@ os@@ ing experience .
When Pro@@ c@@ tor &amp; amp ; G@@ am@@ ble went from 26 different kinds of H@@ ead &amp; amp ; Sh@@ oul@@ ders to 15 , they saw an increase in sal@@ es by 10 percent .
When the Gol@@ den C@@ at Cor@@ por@@ ation got rid of their 10 wor@@ st-@@ selling c@@ at li@@ tter products , they saw an increase in prof@@ its by 8@@ 7 percent -- a function of both increase in sal@@ es and lo@@ wering of costs .
You know , the average gro@@ cer@@ y store today off@@ ers you 4@@ 5,000 products .
The typical Wal@@ mar@@ t today off@@ ers you 100,000 products .
But the n@@ in@@ th largest re@@ ta@@ il@@ er , the n@@ in@@ th biggest re@@ ta@@ il@@ er in the world today is Al@@ di , and it off@@ ers you only 1,@@ 400 products -- one kind of can@@ ned tom@@ a@@ to sa@@ u@@ ce .
Now in the financial sa@@ vi@@ ngs world , I think one of the best examples that has recently come out on how to best manage the choice offer@@ ings has actually been something that David La@@ i@@ b@@ son was hea@@ vi@@ ly involved in designing , which was the program that they have at Harvard .
Every single Harvard employ@@ ee is now autom@@ a@@ tically en@@ rol@@ led in a lif@@ ec@@ y@@ cle fu@@ nd .
For those people who actually want to choose , they &apos;re given 20 fun@@ ds , not 300 or more fun@@ ds .
You know , often , people say , &quot; I don &apos;t know how to cut .
They &apos;re all important choices . &quot;
And the first thing I do is I ask the employees , &quot; T@@ ell me how these choices are different from one another .
And if your employees can &apos;t tell them apart , ne@@ i@@ ther can your consum@@ ers . &quot;
Now before we started our s@@ ession this after@@ no@@ on , I had a ch@@ at with G@@ ary .
And G@@ ary said that he would be willing to offer people in this audience an al@@ l-@@ expen@@ s@@ es@@ -@@ paid free v@@ ac@@ ation to the most beautiful road in the world .
Here &apos;s a descri@@ p@@ tion of the road .
And I &apos;d like you to read it .
And now I &apos;ll give you a few seconds to read it and then I want you to cla@@ p your hands if you &apos;re ready to take G@@ ary up on his offer .
Okay . Any@@ body who &apos;s ready to take him up on his offer .
Is that all ?
All right , let me show you some more about this .
You guys knew there was a trick , didn &apos;t you .
Now who &apos;s ready to go on this trip .
I think I might have actually heard more hands .
All right .
Now in fact , you had ob@@ jec@@ tively more information the first time around than the second time around , but I would ven@@ ture to guess that you felt that it was more real the second time around .
Because the pictures made it feel more real to you .
Which brings me to the second techni@@ que for hand@@ ling the choice over@@ load problem , which is con@@ cre@@ ti@@ zation .
That in order for people to understand the differences between the choices , they have to be able to understand the consequences associated with each choice , and that the consequences need to be felt in a vi@@ vid sort of way , in a very con@@ crete way .
Why do people spend an average of 15 to 30 percent more when they use an A@@ T@@ M card or a credit card as op@@ posed to c@@ ash ?
Because it doesn &apos;t feel like real money .
And it turns out that making it feel more con@@ crete can actually be a very positive tool to use in getting people to save more .
So a study that I did with Sh@@ l@@ omo Ben@@ art@@ z@@ i and Al@@ ess@@ and@@ ro P@@ rev@@ it@@ er@@ o , we did a study with people at I@@ N@@ G -- employees that are all working at I@@ N@@ G -- and now these people were all in a s@@ ession where they &apos;re doing en@@ rol@@ l@@ ment for their 40@@ 1 plan .
And during that s@@ ession , we kept the s@@ ession exactly the way it used to be , but we added one little thing .
The one little thing we added was we asked people to just think about all the positive things that would happen in your life if you saved more .
By doing that simple thing , there was an increase in en@@ rol@@ l@@ ment by 20 percent and there was an increase in the amount of people willing to save or the amount that they were willing to put down into their sa@@ vi@@ ngs account by four percent .
The third techni@@ que : C@@ ate@@ gori@@ zation .
We can hand@@ le more categ@@ ories than we can hand@@ le choices .
So for example , here &apos;s a study we did in a magazine a@@ is@@ le .
It turns out that in We@@ g@@ m@@ ans gro@@ cer@@ y sto@@ res up and down the nor@@ the@@ ast cor@@ ri@@ d@@ or , the magazine a@@ is@@ les range anywhere from 3@@ 31 different kinds of magaz@@ ines all the way up to 6@@ 6@@ 4 .
But you know what ?
If I show you 600 magaz@@ ines and I divi@@ de them up into 10 categ@@ ories , versus I show you 400 magaz@@ ines and divi@@ de them up into 20 categ@@ ories , you believe that I have given you more choice and a better cho@@ os@@ ing experience if I gave you the 400 than if I gave you the 600 .
Because the categ@@ ories tell me how to tell them apart .
Here are two different je@@ wel@@ ry disp@@ la@@ ys .
One is called &quot; Ja@@ zz &quot; and the other one is called &quot; S@@ wing . &quot;
If you think the disp@@ lay on the left is S@@ wing and the disp@@ lay on the right is Ja@@ zz , cla@@ p your hands .
Okay , there &apos;s some .
If you think the one on the left is Ja@@ zz and the one on the right is S@@ wing , cla@@ p your hands .
Okay , a bit more .
Now it turns out you &apos;re right .
The one on the left is Ja@@ zz and the one on the right is S@@ wing , but you know what ?
This is a highly us@@ eless cate@@ gori@@ zation s@@ che@@ me .
The categ@@ ories need to say something to the cho@@ os@@ er , not the cho@@ ic@@ e-@@ maker .
And you often see that problem when it comes down to those long li@@ sts of all these fun@@ ds .
Who are they actually supposed to be in@@ forming ?
My fourth techni@@ que : Con@@ dition for complexity .
It turns out we can actually hand@@ le a lot more information than we think we can , we &apos;ve just got to take it a little easier .
We have to gradu@@ ally increase the complexity .
I &apos;m going to show you one example of what I &apos;m talking about .
Let &apos;s take a very , very complicated decision : buying a car .
Here &apos;s a Ger@@ man car manufac@@ tu@@ re@@ r that gives you the opportunity to completely cu@@ st@@ om make your car .
You &apos;ve got to make 60 different decisions , completely make up your car .
Now these decisions v@@ ary in the number of choices that they offer per decision .
C@@ ar colors , ex@@ ter@@ ior car colors -- I &apos;ve got 5@@ 6 choices .
Eng@@ ines , g@@ ear@@ shift -- four choices .
So now what I &apos;m going to do is I &apos;m going to v@@ ary the order in which these decisions appear .
So half of the custom@@ ers are going to go from high choice , 5@@ 6 car colors , to low choice , four g@@ ear@@ shif@@ ts .
The other half of the custom@@ ers are going to go from low choice , four g@@ ear@@ shif@@ ts , to 5@@ 6 car colors , high choice .
What am I going to look at ?
How engaged you are .
If you keep h@@ itting the de@@ fa@@ ul@@ t butt@@ on per decision , that means you &apos;re getting overwhel@@ med , that means I &apos;m losing you .
What you find is the people who go from high choice to low choice , they &apos;re h@@ itting that de@@ fa@@ ul@@ t butt@@ on over and over and over again .
We &apos;re losing them .
They go from low choice to high choice , they &apos;re h@@ ang@@ ing in there .
It &apos;s the same information . It &apos;s the same number of choices .
The only thing that I have done is I have vari@@ ed the order in which that information is presen@@ ted .
If I start you off easy , I learn how to choose .
Even though cho@@ os@@ ing g@@ ear@@ shift doesn &apos;t tell me anything about my pre@@ fer@@ ences for inter@@ ior dec@@ or , it still prepar@@ es me for how to choose .
It also gets me excited about this big product that I &apos;m putting together , so I &apos;m more willing to be motiv@@ ated to be engaged .
So let me re@@ ca@@ p .
I have talked about four techniques for mi@@ ti@@ ga@@ ting the problem of choice over@@ load -- cut -- get rid of the ex@@ tran@@ e@@ ous alter@@ na@@ tives ; con@@ cre@@ ti@@ ze -- make it real ; cate@@ gori@@ ze -- we can hand@@ le more categ@@ ories , less choices ; condition for complexity .
All of these techniques that I &apos;m descri@@ bing to you today are designed to help you manage your choices -- better for you , you can use them on yourself , better for the people that you are ser@@ ving .
Because I believe that the key to getting the most from choice is to be cho@@ os@@ y about cho@@ os@@ ing .
And the more we &apos;re able to be cho@@ os@@ y about cho@@ os@@ ing the better we will be able to practice the art of cho@@ os@@ ing .
Thank you very much .
I think we have to do something about a piece of the culture of medicine that has to change .
And I think it starts with one physici@@ an , and that &apos;s me .
And maybe I &apos;ve been around long enough that I can afford to give away some of my false pre@@ sti@@ ge to be able to do that .
Be@@ fore I actually begin the meat of my talk , let &apos;s begin with a bit of bas@@ e@@ ball .
Hey , why not ?
We &apos;re near the end , we &apos;re getting close to the World Ser@@ ies .
We all love bas@@ e@@ ball , don &apos;t we ?
B@@ as@@ e@@ ball is filled with some amazing statistics .
And there &apos;s hundreds of them .
&quot; Mon@@ ey@@ ball &quot; is about to come out , and it &apos;s all about statistics and using statistics to build a great bas@@ e@@ ball team .
I &apos;m going to focus on one st@@ at that I hope a lot of you have heard of .
It &apos;s called bat@@ ting average .
So we talk about a 300 , a bat@@ ter who b@@ ats 300 .
That means that bal@@ l@@ player bat@@ ted safe@@ ly , hit safe@@ ly three times out of 10 at b@@ ats .
That means hit the ball into the out@@ field , it dro@@ pped , it didn &apos;t get caught , and wh@@ o@@ ever tried to throw it to first base didn &apos;t get there in time and the run@@ ner was safe .
Three times out of 10 .
Do you know what they call a 300 h@@ it@@ ter in Ma@@ j@@ or Le@@ agu@@ e B@@ as@@ e@@ ball ?
Good , really good , maybe an al@@ l-@@ star .
Do you know what they call a 400 bas@@ e@@ ball h@@ it@@ ter ?
That &apos;s somebody who hit , by the way , four times safe@@ ly out of every 10 .
Le@@ gen@@ d@@ ary -- as in T@@ ed Willi@@ ams le@@ gen@@ d@@ ary -- the last Ma@@ j@@ or Le@@ agu@@ e B@@ as@@ e@@ ball player to hit over 400 during a regular se@@ ason .
Now let &apos;s take this back into my world of medicine where I &apos;m a lot more comfortable , or perhaps a bit less comfortable after what I &apos;m going to talk to you about .
Su@@ pp@@ ose you have app@@ en@@ di@@ ci@@ ti@@ s and you &apos;re refer@@ red to a sur@@ geon who &apos;s bat@@ ting 400 on app@@ en@@ dec@@ tom@@ ies .
Some@@ how this isn &apos;t working out , is it ?
Now supp@@ ose you live in a certain part of a certain remote place and you have a loved one who has blo@@ ck@@ ages in two cor@@ on@@ ary ar@@ ter@@ ies and your family doctor ref@@ ers that loved one to a car@@ dio@@ logist who &apos;s bat@@ ting 200 on an@@ gi@@ op@@ las@@ ties .
But , but , you know what ?
She &apos;s doing a lot better this year . She &apos;s on the com@@ e@@ back tra@@ il .
And she &apos;s h@@ itting a 2@@ 5@@ 7 .
Some@@ how this isn &apos;t working .
But I &apos;m going to ask you a question .
What do you think a bat@@ ting average for a car@@ di@@ ac sur@@ geon or a nur@@ se prac@@ ti@@ tion@@ er or an or@@ th@@ op@@ e@@ dic sur@@ geon , an O@@ B@@ G@@ Y@@ N , a para@@ medi@@ c is supposed to be ?
1,000 , very good .
Now truth of the matter is , nobody knows in all of medicine what a good sur@@ geon or physici@@ an or para@@ medi@@ c is supposed to b@@ at .
What we do though is we send each one of them , including myself , out into the world with the ad@@ mon@@ ition , be perfect .
N@@ ever ever , ever make a mista@@ ke , but you worry about the details , about how that &apos;s going to happen .
And that was the message that I ab@@ sor@@ bed when I was in med school .
I was an obs@@ es@@ sive compu@@ l@@ sive student .
In high school , a cl@@ as@@ sm@@ ate once said that Brian Gol@@ d@@ man would study for a blood test .
And so I did .
And I studied in my little gar@@ re@@ t at the nur@@ ses &apos; resi@@ dence at Tor@@ onto G@@ ener@@ al H@@ os@@ pit@@ al , not far from here .
And I mem@@ ori@@ zed everything .
I mem@@ ori@@ zed in my an@@ at@@ omy class the orig@@ ins and ex@@ er@@ tions of every mus@@ cle , every bran@@ ch of every ar@@ tery that came off the a@@ or@@ ta , differ@@ ential diagnos@@ es obs@@ cure and common .
I even knew the differ@@ ential diagnos@@ is in how to classi@@ fy ren@@ al tu@@ bu@@ lar ac@@ id@@ os@@ is .
And all the while , I was am@@ ass@@ ing more and more knowledge .
And I did well , I gradu@@ ated with hon@@ ors , cu@@ m lau@@ de .
And I came out of medical school with the impres@@ sion that if I mem@@ ori@@ zed everything and knew everything , or as much as possible , as close to everything as possible , that it would immu@@ ni@@ ze me against making mistakes .
And it worked for a while , until I met M@@ r@@ s@@ . D@@ ru@@ c@@ ker .
I was a resident at a teaching hospital here in Tor@@ onto when M@@ r@@ s@@ . D@@ ru@@ c@@ ker was brought to the emer@@ gency de@@ partment of the hospital where I was working .
At the time I was as@@ signed to the car@@ di@@ ology service on a car@@ di@@ ology rot@@ ation .
And it was my job , when the emer@@ gency staff called for a car@@ di@@ ology con@@ sul@@ t , to see that patient in emer@@ g .
and to report back to my atten@@ ding .
And I saw M@@ r@@ s@@ . D@@ ru@@ c@@ ker , and she was brea@@ th@@ less .
And when I list@@ ened to her , she was making a whe@@ e@@ zy sound .
And when I list@@ ened to her chest with a ste@@ th@@ os@@ cope , I could hear cr@@ ack@@ ly sounds on both sides that told me that she was in co@@ ng@@ es@@ tive heart failure .
This is a condition in which the heart fail@@ s , and instead of being able to p@@ ump all the blood forward , some of the blood b@@ acks up into the lung , the lu@@ ngs fill up with blood , and that &apos;s why you have short@@ ness of breath .
And that wasn &apos;t a difficult diagnos@@ is to make .
I made it and I set to work tr@@ eating her .
I gave her asp@@ ir@@ in . I gave her medi@@ cations to reli@@ eve the stra@@ in on her heart .
I gave her medi@@ cations that we call di@@ u@@ re@@ tics , water p@@ ills , to get her to pe@@ e out the access flu@@ id .
And over the course of the next hour and a half or two , she started to feel better .
And I felt really good .
And that &apos;s when I made my first mista@@ ke ; I sent her home .
Actually , I made two more mistakes .
I sent her home without speaking to my atten@@ ding .
I didn &apos;t pick up the phone and do what I was supposed to do , which was call my atten@@ ding and run the story by him so he would have a chance to see her for himself .
And he knew her , he would have been able to fur@@ ni@@ sh ad@@ di@@ tional information about her .
Maybe I did it for a good reason .
Maybe I didn &apos;t want to be a high-@@ ma@@ inten@@ ance resident .
Maybe I wanted to be so successful and so able to take responsibility that I would do so and I would be able to take care of my atten@@ ding &apos;s patients without even having to contact him .
The second mista@@ ke that I made was worse .
In sending her home , I dis@@ re@@ gar@@ ded a little voice deep down inside that was trying to tell me , &quot; Gol@@ d@@ man , not a good idea . Don &apos;t do this . &quot;
In fact , so l@@ acking in confidence was I that I actually asked the nur@@ se who was looking after M@@ r@@ s@@ . D@@ ru@@ c@@ ker , &quot; Do you think it &apos;s okay if she goes home ? &quot;
And the nur@@ se thought about it and said very mat@@ ter@@ -@@ of@@ -@@ fac@@ tly , &quot; Yeah , I think she &apos;ll do okay . &quot;
I can remember that like it was y@@ esterday .
So I signed the dis@@ charge p@@ apers , and an am@@ bul@@ ance came , para@@ medi@@ cs came to take her home .
And I went back to my work on the wards .
All the rest of that day , that after@@ no@@ on , I had this kind of g@@ na@@ wing feeling inside my stom@@ ach .
But I car@@ ried on with my work .
And at the end of the day , I p@@ acked up to leave the hospital and walked to the par@@ king lot to take my car and drive home when I did something that I don &apos;t usually do .
I walked through the emer@@ gency de@@ partment on my way home .
And it was there that another nur@@ se , not the nur@@ se who was looking after M@@ r@@ s@@ . D@@ ru@@ c@@ ker before , but another nur@@ se , said three words to me that are the three words that most emer@@ gency physici@@ ans I know dre@@ ad .
O@@ thers in medicine dre@@ ad them as well , but there &apos;s something particular about emer@@ gency medicine because we see patients so fle@@ e@@ ti@@ ngly .
The three words are : Do you remember ?
&quot; Do you remember that patient you sent home ? &quot;
the other nur@@ se asked mat@@ ter@@ -@@ of@@ -@@ fac@@ tly .
&quot; Well she &apos;s back , &quot; in just that t@@ one of voice .
Well she was back all right .
She was back and near death .
Ab@@ out an hour after she had arrived home , after I &apos;d sent her home , she collap@@ sed and her family called 9@@ 11 and the para@@ medi@@ cs brought her back to the emer@@ gency de@@ partment where she had a blood pressure of 50 , which is in se@@ v@@ ere shock .
And she was bar@@ ely brea@@ thing and she was blue .
And the emer@@ g@@ . staff pul@@ led out all the stop@@ s .
They gave her medi@@ cations to raise her blood pressure .
They put her on a v@@ enti@@ l@@ ator .
And I was sho@@ cked and sha@@ ken to the core .
And I went through this rol@@ ler co@@ a@@ ster , because after they st@@ abi@@ li@@ zed her , she went to the inten@@ sive care unit , and I ho@@ ped against hope that she would reco@@ ver .
And over the next two or three days , it was clear that she was never going to wake up .
She had ir@@ re@@ ver@@ sible brain damage .
And the family gather@@ ed .
And over the course of the next eight or nine days , they re@@ signed themselves to what was happening .
And at about the nine day mark , they let her go -- M@@ r@@ s@@ . D@@ ru@@ c@@ ker , a wife , a mother and a grandmother .
They say you never forget the names of those who die .
And that was my first time to be ac@@ qua@@ in@@ ted with that .
Over the next few weeks , I beat myself up and I experienced for the first time the u@@ nh@@ eal@@ thy sha@@ me that exists in our culture of medicine -- where I felt alone , isol@@ ated , not feeling the healthy kind of sha@@ me that you feel , because you can &apos;t talk about it with your colleagues .
You know that healthy kind , when you be@@ tr@@ ay a secret that a best friend made you promise never to reve@@ al and then you get bu@@ sted and then your best friend conf@@ ron@@ ts you and you have terrible discus@@ sions , but at the end of it all that sick feeling gui@@ des you and you say , I &apos;ll never make that mista@@ ke again .
And you make am@@ ends and you never make that mista@@ ke again .
That &apos;s the kind of sha@@ me that is a teacher .
The u@@ nh@@ eal@@ thy sha@@ me I &apos;m talking about is the one that makes you so sick inside .
It &apos;s the one that says , not that what you did was bad , but that you are bad .
And it was what I was feeling .
And it wasn &apos;t because of my atten@@ ding ; he was a dol@@ l .
He talked to the family , and I &apos;m quite sure that he smo@@ o@@ the@@ d things over and made sure that I didn &apos;t get su@@ ed .
And I kept asking myself these questions .
Why didn &apos;t I ask my atten@@ ding ? Why did I send her home ?
And then at my worst moments : Why did I make such a stupid mista@@ ke ?
Why did I go into medicine ?
S@@ low@@ ly but su@@ rely , it lif@@ ted .
I began to feel a bit better .
And on a clou@@ dy day , there was a cr@@ ack in the clou@@ ds and the sun started to come out and I wondered , maybe I could feel better again .
And I made myself a bar@@ gain that if only I re@@ double my effor@@ ts to be perfect and never make another mista@@ ke again , please make the voices stop .
And they did .
And I went back to work .
And then it happened again .
Two years later I was an atten@@ ding in the emer@@ gency de@@ partment at a community hospital just nor@@ th of Tor@@ onto , and I saw a 25 year-old man with a s@@ ore thro@@ at .
It was bus@@ y , I was in a bit of a hur@@ ry .
He kept poin@@ ting here .
I looked at his thro@@ at , it was a little bit p@@ ink .
And I gave him a pres@@ crip@@ tion for pen@@ ic@@ ill@@ in and sent him on his way .
And even as he was walking out the door , he was still sort of poin@@ ting to his thro@@ at .
And two days later I came to do my next emer@@ gency shift , and that &apos;s when my chi@@ ef asked to speak to me qui@@ e@@ tly in her office .
And she said the three words : Do you remember ?
&quot; Do you remember that patient you saw with the s@@ ore thro@@ at ? &quot;
Well it turns out , he didn &apos;t have a str@@ ep thro@@ at .
He had a pot@@ entially life@@ -@@ threat@@ ening condition called ep@@ ig@@ lot@@ ti@@ ti@@ s .
You can Google it , but it &apos;s an inf@@ ection , not of the thro@@ at , but of the u@@ pper air@@ way , and it can actually cause the air@@ way to close .
And fortunately he didn &apos;t die .
He was placed on in@@ tra@@ ven@@ ous anti@@ bio@@ tics and he reco@@ vered after a few days .
And I went through the same period of sha@@ me and rec@@ ri@@ min@@ ations and felt cle@@ ans@@ ed and went back to work , until it happened again and again and again .
T@@ wi@@ ce in one emer@@ gency shift , I mis@@ sed app@@ en@@ di@@ ci@@ ti@@ s .
Now that takes some doing , especially when you work in a hospital that at the time saw but 14 people a night .
Now in both cases , I didn &apos;t send them home and I don &apos;t think there was any gap in their care .
One I thought had a kid@@ ney stone .
I or@@ dered a kid@@ ney X-@@ ray . When it turned out to be normal , my colleagu@@ e who was doing a reas@@ s@@ ess@@ ment of the patient noticed some ten@@ der@@ ness in the right lower qu@@ ad@@ r@@ ant and called the sur@@ ge@@ ons .
The other one had a lot of di@@ ar@@ r@@ he@@ a .
I or@@ dered some flu@@ i@@ ds to re@@ hy@@ dr@@ ate him and asked my colleagu@@ e to reas@@ s@@ ess him .
And he did and when he noticed some ten@@ der@@ ness in the right lower qu@@ ad@@ r@@ ant , called the sur@@ ge@@ ons .
In both cases , they had their oper@@ ations and they did okay .
But each time , they were g@@ na@@ wing at me , eating at me .
And I &apos;d like to be able to say to you that my worst mistakes only happened in the first five years of practice as many of my colleagues say , which is total B@@ .@@ S.
Some of my do@@ o@@ z@@ ies have been in the last five years .
Al@@ one , as@@ ha@@ med and un@@ suppor@@ ted .
Here &apos;s the problem : If I can &apos;t come clean and talk about my mistakes , if I can &apos;t find the sti@@ l@@ l-@@ small voice that tells me what really happened , how can I share it with my colleagues ?
How can I teach them about what I did so that they don &apos;t do the same thing ?
If I were to walk into a room -- like right now , I have no idea what you think of me .
When was the last time you heard somebody talk about failure after failure after failure ?
Oh yeah , you go to a co@@ ck@@ tail party and you might hear about some other doctor , but you &apos;re not going to hear somebody talking about their own mistakes .
If I were to walk into a room filled with my colle@@ ages and ask for their support right now and start to tell what I &apos;ve just told you right now , I probably wouldn &apos;t get through two of those stories before they would start to get really un@@ comfortable , somebody would cr@@ ack a jo@@ ke , they &apos;d change the subject and we would move on .
And in fact , if I knew and my colleagues knew that one of my or@@ th@@ op@@ e@@ dic colleagues took off the wrong leg in my hospital , believe me , I &apos;d have trouble making eye contact with that person .
That &apos;s the system that we have .
It &apos;s a complete den@@ ial of mistakes .
It &apos;s a system in which there are two kinds of physici@@ ans -- those who make mistakes and those who don &apos;t , those who can &apos;t hand@@ le sleep de@@ pri@@ vation and those who can , those who have l@@ ous@@ y out@@ comes and those who have great out@@ comes .
And it &apos;s almost like an ide@@ ological reaction , like the anti@@ bodies begin to attack that person .
And we have this idea that if we drive the people who make mistakes out of medicine , what will we be left with , but a safe system .
But there are two problems with that .
In my 20 years or so of medical broad@@ cas@@ ting and journ@@ alism , I &apos;ve made a personal study of medical mal@@ practice and medical er@@ r@@ ors to learn everything I can , from one of the first artic@@ les I wrote for the Tor@@ onto S@@ tar to my show &quot; Wh@@ ite Co@@ at , B@@ lack Art . &quot;
And what I &apos;ve learned is that er@@ r@@ ors are absolutely u@@ bi@@ quit@@ ous .
We work in a system where er@@ r@@ ors happen every day , where one in 10 medi@@ cations are either the wrong medi@@ cation given in hospital or at the wrong d@@ os@@ age , where hospit@@ al@@ -@@ ac@@ qui@@ red inf@@ ec@@ tions are getting more and more num@@ er@@ ous , ca@@ using ha@@ vo@@ c and death .
In this country , as many as 2@@ 4@@ ,000 Can@@ a@@ di@@ ans die of preven@@ table medical er@@ r@@ ors .
In the United States , the In@@ stitute of Me@@ dic@@ ine pe@@ gged it at 100,000 .
In both cases , these are gr@@ oss under@@ esti@@ mates , because we really aren &apos;t fer@@ re@@ ting out the problem as we should .
And here &apos;s the thing .
In a hospital system where medical knowledge is doub@@ ling every two or three years , we can &apos;t keep up with it .
S@@ le@@ ep de@@ pri@@ vation is absolutely per@@ va@@ sive .
We can &apos;t get rid of it .
We have our cognitive bi@@ ases , so that I can take a perfect history on a patient with chest pain .
Now take the same patient with chest pain , make them mo@@ ist and gar@@ ru@@ l@@ ous and put a little bit of al@@ co@@ ho@@ l on their breath , and suddenly my history is l@@ ac@@ ed with con@@ temp@@ t .
I don &apos;t take the same history .
I &apos;m not a robot ; I don &apos;t do things the same way each time .
And my patients aren &apos;t cars ; they don &apos;t tell me their symp@@ tom@@ s in the same way each time .
Gi@@ ven all of that , mistakes are in@@ ev@@ itable .
So if you take the system , as I was taught , and we@@ ed out all the er@@ r@@ or@@ -@@ pr@@ one health profes@@ sion@@ als , well there won &apos;t be anybody left .
And you know that business about people not wan@@ ting to talk about their worst cases ?
On my show , on &quot; Wh@@ ite Co@@ at , B@@ lack Art , &quot; I made it a ha@@ bit of saying , &quot; Here &apos;s my worst mista@@ ke , &quot; I would say to everybody from para@@ medi@@ cs to the chi@@ ef of car@@ di@@ ac surgery , &quot; Here &apos;s my worst mista@@ ke , &quot; bla@@ h , bla@@ h , bla@@ h , bla@@ h , bla@@ h , &quot; What about y@@ ours ? &quot; and I would point the micro@@ phone towards them .
And their pu@@ p@@ ils would di@@ late , they would reco@@ il , then they would look down and s@@ wal@@ low hard and start to tell me their stories .
They want to tell their stories . They want to share their stories .
They want to be able to say , &quot; Look , don &apos;t make the same mista@@ ke I did . &quot;
What they need is an environment to be able to do that .
What they need is a re@@ defined medical culture .
And it starts with one physici@@ an at a time .
The re@@ defined physici@@ an is human , knows she &apos;s human , accep@@ ts it , isn &apos;t proud of making mistakes , but stri@@ ves to learn one thing from what happened that she can teach to somebody else .
She shares her experience with others .
She &apos;s suppor@@ tive when other people talk about their mistakes .
And she points out other people &apos;s mistakes , not in a got@@ cha way , but in a lo@@ ving , suppor@@ tive way so that everybody can benefit .
And she works in a culture of medicine that ac@@ knowle@@ d@@ ges that human beings run the system , and when human beings run the system , they will make mistakes from time to time .
So the system is evol@@ ving to create back@@ u@@ ps that make it easier to det@@ ect those mistakes that humans in@@ ev@@ it@@ ably make and also f@@ os@@ ters in a lo@@ ving , suppor@@ tive way places where everybody who is obser@@ ving in the health care system can actually point out things that could be potential mistakes and is re@@ war@@ ded for doing so , and especially people like me , when we do make mistakes , we &apos;re re@@ war@@ ded for coming clean .
My name is Brian Gol@@ d@@ man .
I am a re@@ defined physici@@ an .
I &apos;m human . I make mistakes .
I &apos;m sorry about that , but I stri@@ ve to learn one thing that I can pass on to other people .
I still don &apos;t know what you think of me , but I can live with that .
And let me close with three words of my own : I do remember .
Hi . I &apos;m K@@ ev@@ in Al@@ lo@@ c@@ ca , I &apos;m the tr@@ ends manag@@ er at YouTube , and I profes@@ sion@@ ally watch YouTube videos .
It &apos;s true .
So we &apos;re going to talk a little bit today about how videos go vir@@ al and then why that even matters .
We all want to be stars -- cele@@ bri@@ ties , sing@@ ers , com@@ e@@ di@@ ans -- and when I was you@@ nger , that seemed so very , very hard to do .
But now Web video has made it so that any of us or any of the creative things that we do can become completely famous in a part of our world &apos;s culture .
An@@ y one of you could be famous on the Internet by next S@@ atur@@ day .
But there are over 4@@ 8 hours of video up@@ lo@@ aded to YouTube every minute .
And of that , only a tiny percent@@ age ever goes vir@@ al and gets tons of views and becomes a cultural moment .
So how does it happen ?
Three things : ta@@ st@@ ema@@ kers , communities of particip@@ ation and unex@@ p@@ ec@@ te@@ dness .
All right , let &apos;s go .
Oh , my God . Oh , my God .
Oh , my God !
W@@ oo@@ o !
O@@ h@@ h@@ h@@ h@@ h , w@@ ow@@ w@@ w@@ w !
Last year , B@@ ear V@@ as@@ qu@@ e@@ z pos@@ ted this video that he had shot outside his home in Y@@ os@@ em@@ ite National Par@@ k .
In 2010 , it was vie@@ wed 23 million times .
This is a ch@@ art of what it looked like when it first became popular last summer .
But he didn &apos;t actually set out to make a vir@@ al video , B@@ ear .
He just wanted to share a rain@@ bo@@ w .
Because that &apos;s what you do when your name is Y@@ os@@ em@@ ite M@@ oun@@ tain B@@ ear .
And he had pos@@ ted lots of nature videos in fact .
And this video had actually been pos@@ ted all the way back in Jan@@ u@@ ary .
So what happened here ?
J@@ im@@ my K@@ im@@ me@@ l actually .
J@@ im@@ my K@@ im@@ me@@ l pos@@ ted this twe@@ et that would eventually pro@@ pe@@ l the video to be as popular as it would become .
Because ta@@ st@@ ema@@ kers like J@@ im@@ my K@@ im@@ me@@ l introduce us to new and interesting things and bring them to a larger audience .
It &apos;s Fri@@ day , Fri@@ day . G@@ ot@@ ta get down on Fri@@ day . Everybody &apos;s looking forward to the wee@@ k@@ end , wee@@ k@@ end . Fri@@ day , Fri@@ day . G@@ et@@ tin &apos; down on Fri@@ day . So you didn &apos;t think that we could actually have this conversation without talking about this video I hope .
Re@@ bec@@ ca B@@ lack &apos;s &quot; Fri@@ day &quot; is one of the most popular videos of the year .
It &apos;s been seen nearly 200 million times this year .
This is a ch@@ art of what it looked like .
And similar to &quot; D@@ ou@@ ble Ra@@ in@@ bo@@ w , &quot; it seems to have just sp@@ rou@@ ted up out of no@@ where .
So what happened on this day ?
Well it was a Fri@@ day , this is true .
And if you &apos;re wondering about those other spi@@ kes , those are also Fri@@ days .
But what about this day , this one particular Fri@@ day ?
Well T@@ os@@ h@@ .@@ 0 picked it up , a lot of blo@@ gs starting writing about .
Michael J@@ . N@@ el@@ son from M@@ yst@@ ery S@@ cience The@@ ater was one of the first people to p@@ ost a jo@@ ke about the video on Twitter .
But what &apos;s important is that an individual or a group of ta@@ st@@ ema@@ kers took a point of view and they shared that with a larger audience , acceler@@ ating the process .
And so then this community formed of people who shared this big inside jo@@ ke and they started talking about it and doing things with it .
And now there are 10,000 par@@ o@@ dies of &quot; Fri@@ day &quot; on YouTube .
Even in the first seven days , there was one par@@ o@@ dy for every other day of the week .
Un@@ like the one-@@ way enter@@ tainment of the 20th century , this community particip@@ ation is how we become a part of the phenomenon -- either by sp@@ reading it or by doing something new with it .
So &quot; N@@ yan C@@ at &quot; is a lo@@ op@@ ed ani@@ mation with lo@@ op@@ ed music .
It &apos;s this , just like this .
It &apos;s been vie@@ wed nearly 50 million times this year .
And if you think that that is weird , you should know that there is a three-@@ hour version of this that &apos;s been vie@@ wed four million times .
Even c@@ ats were watching this video .
C@@ ats were watching other c@@ ats watch this video .
But what &apos;s important here is the creativity that it inspired a@@ mo@@ ng@@ st this te@@ chi@@ e , ge@@ e@@ ky Internet culture .
There were re@@ mi@@ xes .
Some@@ one made an old ti@@ me@@ y version .
And then it went international .
An entire re@@ mix community sp@@ rou@@ ted up that brought it from being just a stupid jo@@ ke to something that we can all actually be a part of .
Because we don &apos;t just enjoy now , we particip@@ ate .
And who could have predic@@ ted any of this ?
Who could have predic@@ ted &quot; D@@ ou@@ ble Ra@@ in@@ bo@@ w &quot; or Re@@ bec@@ ca B@@ lack or &quot; N@@ yan C@@ at ? &quot;
What s@@ crip@@ ts could you have written that would have conta@@ ined this in it ?
In a world where over two days of video get up@@ lo@@ aded every minute , only that which is truly unique and unexpected can stand out in the way that these things have .
When a friend of mine told me that I needed to see this great video about a guy prot@@ esting b@@ ic@@ y@@ cle fin@@ es in New York City , I ad@@ mit I wasn &apos;t very interested .
So I got a tic@@ ket for not ri@@ ding in the bike lan@@ e , but often there are ob@@ struc@@ tions that keep you from proper@@ ly ri@@ ding in the bike lan@@ e .
By being totally surprising and hum@@ or@@ ous , C@@ as@@ ey Ni@@ est@@ at got his funny idea and point seen five million times .
And so this approach hol@@ ds for anything new that we do crea@@ tively .
And so it all brings us to one big question ...
What does this mean ?
O@@ h@@ h@@ h@@ h .
What does it mean ?
Ta@@ st@@ ema@@ kers , creative parti@@ ci@@ pa@@ ting communities , complete unex@@ p@@ ec@@ te@@ dness , these are character@@ is@@ tics of a new kind of media and a new kind of culture where anyone has access and the audience defin@@ es the popu@@ lar@@ ity .
I mean , as mentioned earlier , one of the biggest stars in the world right now , J@@ us@@ tin Bi@@ e@@ ber , got his start on YouTube .
No one has to gre@@ en@@ -@@ light your idea .
And we all now feel some ow@@ ner@@ ship in our own pop culture .
And these are not character@@ is@@ tics of old media , and they &apos;re bar@@ ely true of the media of today , but they will define the enter@@ tainment of the future .
Thank you .
Today I &apos;m going to talk about unexpected disco@@ ver@@ ies .
Now I work in the solar technology industry .
And my small star@@ tu@@ p is looking to force ourselves into the environment by paying attention to ...
... paying attention to crow@@ d-@@ sour@@ cing .
It &apos;s just a quick video of what we do .
Hu@@ h . H@@ ang on a moment .
It might take a moment to load .
We &apos;ll just -- we can just ski@@ p -- I &apos;ll just ski@@ p through the video instead ...
No .
This is not ...
Okay .
S@@ ol@@ ar technology is ...
Oh , that &apos;s all my time ?
Okay . Thank you very much .
My story begins right here actually in Ra@@ j@@ as@@ than about two years ago .
I was in the des@@ ert , under the star@@ ry ski@@ es with the Su@@ f@@ i sing@@ er Mu@@ kh@@ ti@@ ar Al@@ i .
And we were in conversation about how nothing had changed since the time of the ancient Indian ep@@ ic &quot; The Ma@@ ha@@ b@@ har@@ a@@ ta . &quot;
So back in the day , when us In@@ di@@ ans wanted to travel we &apos;d jump into a ch@@ ari@@ ot and we &apos;d zo@@ om across the sky .
Now we do the same with air@@ plan@@ es .
B@@ ack then , when Ar@@ j@@ un@@ a , the great Indian war@@ ri@@ or pr@@ ince , when he was thir@@ sty , he &apos;d take out a bo@@ w , he &apos;d sho@@ ot it into the ground and water would come out .
Now we do the same with dri@@ l@@ ls and machines .
The concl@@ usion that we came to was that magic had been re@@ placed by mach@@ in@@ ery .
And this made me really sad .
I found myself becoming a little bit of a techno@@ ph@@ o@@ be .
I was terri@@ fied by this idea that I would lose the ability to enjoy and appreci@@ ate the sun@@ set without having my camera on me , without twe@@ e@@ ting it to my friends .
And it felt like technology should en@@ able magic , not kill it .
When I was a little girl , my grandfather gave me his little sil@@ ver po@@ cket watch .
And this piece of 50@@ -year-old technology became the most magi@@ cal thing to me .
It became a gi@@ l@@ ded g@@ ate@@ way into a world full of p@@ ir@@ ates and shi@@ p@@ w@@ rec@@ ks and images in my imagination .
So I felt like our cell@@ phones and our f@@ an@@ cy wat@@ ches and our camer@@ as had stopped us from dre@@ am@@ ing .
They stopped us from being inspired .
And so I jump@@ ed in , I jump@@ ed into this world of technology , to see how I could use it to en@@ able magic as op@@ posed to kill it .
I &apos;ve been ill@@ us@@ tra@@ ting books since I was 16 .
And so when I saw the iP@@ ad , I saw it as a story@@ telling device that could connect read@@ ers all over the world .
It can know how we &apos;re holding it .
It can know where we are .
It brings together image and text and ani@@ mation and sound and touch .
St@@ or@@ y@@ telling is becoming more and more multi-@@ sens@@ ori@@ al .
But what are we doing with it ?
So I &apos;m actually just going to go in and la@@ unch K@@ ho@@ ya , an inter@@ active ap@@ p for the iP@@ ad .
So it says , &quot; P@@ l@@ ace your fing@@ ers upon each light . &quot;
And so -- It says , &quot; This box be@@ lo@@ ngs to ... &quot; And so I type in my name .
And actually I become a character in the book .
At various points , a little letter dro@@ ps down to me -- and the iP@@ ad knows where you live because of GPS -- which is actually addre@@ s@@ sed to me .
The child in me is really excited by these kinds of possibilities .
Now I &apos;ve been talking a lot about magic .
And I don &apos;t mean wi@@ z@@ ards and dra@@ g@@ ons , I mean the kind of childhood magic , those ideas that we all har@@ bo@@ red as children .
This idea of fi@@ ref@@ lies in a j@@ ar , for some reason , was always really exciting to me .
And so over here you need to ti@@ lt your iP@@ ad , take the fi@@ ref@@ lies out .
And they actually il@@ lu@@ min@@ ate your way through the rest of the book .
Another idea that really fascin@@ ated me as a child was that an entire galaxy could be conta@@ ined within a single mar@@ ble .
And so over here , each book and each world becomes a little mar@@ ble that I dra@@ g in to this magi@@ cal device within the device .
And it op@@ ens up a map .
All along , all fant@@ asy books have always had m@@ aps , but these m@@ aps have been sta@@ tic .
This is a map that gro@@ ws and glo@@ ws and becomes your na@@ vi@@ gation for the rest of the book .
It reve@@ als itself to you at certain points in the book as well .
So I &apos;m just going to enter in .
Another thing that &apos;s actually really important to me is creating content that is Indian and yet very con@@ temporary .
Over here , these are the A@@ p@@ s@@ ar@@ as .
So we &apos;ve all heard about fa@@ i@@ ries and we &apos;ve all heard about n@@ ym@@ ph@@ s , but how many people outside of India know about their Indian counter@@ parts , the A@@ p@@ s@@ ar@@ as ?
These poor A@@ p@@ s@@ ar@@ as have been tr@@ apped inside In@@ d@@ ra &apos;s ch@@ am@@ bers for thousands of years in an old and mu@@ sty book .
And so we &apos;re bringing them back in a con@@ temporary story for children .
And a story that actually de@@ als with new issues like the environmental crisis .
S@@ pe@@ a@@ king of the environmental crisis , I think a big problem has been in the last 10 years is that children have been lo@@ cked inside their rooms , g@@ lu@@ ed to their P@@ C@@ s , they haven &apos;t been able to get out .
But now with mobile technology , we can actually take our children outside into the natural world with their technology .
One of the inter@@ actions in the book is that you &apos;re sent off on this quest where you need to go outside , take out your camera on the iP@@ ad and collect pictures of different natural objects .
When I was a child , I had multiple coll@@ ec@@ tions of stic@@ ks and st@@ ones and pe@@ b@@ bles and shel@@ ls .
And somehow kids don &apos;t do that anymore .
So in bringing back this childhood rit@@ ual , you need to go out and , in one ch@@ ap@@ ter , take a picture of a flower and then ta@@ g it .
In another ch@@ ap@@ ter , you need to take a picture of a piece of bar@@ k and then ta@@ g that .
And what happens is that you actually create a digital collection of photographs that you can then put up online .
A child in London puts up a picture of a fo@@ x and says , &quot; Oh , I saw a fo@@ x today . &quot;
A child in India says , &quot; I saw a mon@@ key today . &quot;
And it creates this kind of social network around a collection of digital photographs that you &apos;ve actually taken .
In the possibilities of lin@@ king together magic , the earth and technology , there are multiple possibilities .
In the next book , we plan on having an interaction where you take your iP@@ ad out with the video on and through au@@ g@@ mented reality , you see this layer of anim@@ ated pi@@ x@@ ies appear on a house@@ plant that &apos;s outside your house .
At one point , your screen is filled up with leaves .
And so you need to make the sound of wind and b@@ low them away and read the rest of the book .
We &apos;re moving , we &apos;re all moving here , to a world where the forces of nature come closer together to technology , and magic and technology can come closer together .
We &apos;re har@@ n@@ ess@@ ing energy from the sun .
We &apos;re bringing our children and ourselves closer to the natural world and that magic and joy and childhood love that we had through the simple medium of a story .
Thank you .
Because I usually take the role of trying to explain to people how wonderful the new technologies that are coming along are going to be , and I thought that , since I was among friends here , I would tell you what I really think and try to look back and try to understand what is really going on here with these amazing ju@@ mps in technology that seem so fast that we can bar@@ ely keep on top of it .
So I &apos;m going to start out by showing just one very bor@@ ing technology slide .
And then , so if you can just turn on the slide that &apos;s on .
This is just a random slide that I picked out of my file .
What I want to show you is not so much the details of the slide , but the general form of it .
This happens to be a slide of some analysis that we were doing about the power of R@@ I@@ S@@ C micro@@ process@@ ors versus the power of local area networks .
And the interesting thing about it is that this slide , like so many technology sli@@ des that we &apos;re used to , is a sort of a straight line on a se@@ mi@@ -@@ lo@@ g cur@@ ve .
In other words , every step here re@@ presents an order of mag@@ nit@@ u@@ de in performance scale .
And this is a new thing that we talk about technology on se@@ mi@@ -@@ lo@@ g cur@@ ves .
Some@@ thing really weird is going on here .
And that &apos;s basically what I &apos;m going to be talking about .
So , if you could bring up the lights .
If you could bring up the lights higher , because I &apos;m just going to use a piece of paper here .
Now why do we draw technology cur@@ ves in se@@ mi@@ -@@ lo@@ g cur@@ ves ?
Well the answer is , if I drew it on a normal cur@@ ve where , let &apos;s say , this is years , this is time of some sort , and this is whatever measure of the technology that I &apos;m trying to graph , the graph@@ s look sort of sil@@ ly .
They sort of go like this .
And they don &apos;t tell us much .
Now if I graph , for instance , some other technology , say transpor@@ tation technology , on a se@@ mi@@ -@@ lo@@ g cur@@ ve , it would look very stupid , it would look like a fl@@ at line .
But when something like this happens , things are qu@@ al@@ it@@ a@@ tively changing .
So if transpor@@ tation technology was moving along as fast as micro@@ process@@ or technology , then the day after tomorrow , I would be able to get in a ta@@ xi ca@@ b and be in To@@ ky@@ o in 30 seconds .
It &apos;s not moving like that .
And there &apos;s nothing pre@@ ce@@ den@@ ted in the history of technology development of this kind of self-@@ fe@@ eding growth where you go by or@@ ders of mag@@ nit@@ u@@ de every few years .
Now the question that I &apos;d like to ask is , if you look at these exp@@ on@@ ential cur@@ ves , they don &apos;t go on forever .
Th@@ ings just can &apos;t possibly keep changing as fast as they are .
One of two things is going to happen .
E@@ i@@ ther it &apos;s going to turn into a sort of classi@@ cal S@@ -@@ cur@@ ve like this , until something totally different comes along , or maybe it &apos;s going to do this .
That &apos;s about all it can do .
Now I &apos;m an optimi@@ st , so I sort of think it &apos;s probably going to do something like that .
If so , that means that what we &apos;re in the middle of right now is a transi@@ tion .
We &apos;re sort of on this line in a transi@@ tion from the way the world used to be to some new way that the world is .
And so what I &apos;m trying to ask , what I &apos;ve been asking myself , is what &apos;s this new way that the world is ?
What &apos;s that new state that the world is hea@@ ding toward ?
Because the transi@@ tion seems very , very conf@@ using when we &apos;re right in the middle of it .
Now when I was a kid growing up , the future was kind of the year 2000 , and people used to talk about what would happen in the year 2000 .
Now here &apos;s a conference in which people talk about the future , and you notice that the future is still at about the year 2000 .
It &apos;s about as far as we go out .
So in other words , the future has kind of been sh@@ r@@ in@@ king one year per year for my whole lifetime .
Now I think that the reason is because we all feel that something &apos;s happening there .
That transi@@ tion is happening . We can all sense it .
And we know that it just doesn &apos;t make too much sense to think out 30 , 50 years because everything &apos;s going to be so different that a simple ex@@ tr@@ ap@@ ol@@ ation of what we &apos;re doing just doesn &apos;t make any sense at all .
So what I would like to talk about is what that could be , what that transi@@ tion could be that we &apos;re going through .
Now in order to do that I &apos;m going to have to talk about a bunch of stuff that really has nothing to do with technology and computers .
Because I think the only way to understand this is to really step back and take a long time scale look at things .
So the time scale that I would like to look at this on is the time scale of life on Earth .
So I think this picture makes sense if you look at it a few billion years at a time .
So if you go back about two and a half billion years , the Earth was this big , st@@ eri@@ le hun@@ k of rock with a lot of chemicals flo@@ ating around on it .
And if you look at the way that the chemicals got organized , we begin to get a pretty good idea of how they do it .
And I think that there &apos;s the@@ ories that are beginning to understand about how it started with R@@ NA , but I &apos;m going to tell a sort of simple story of it , which is that , at that time , there were little dro@@ ps of oil flo@@ ating around with all kinds of different reci@@ pes of chemicals in them .
And some of those dro@@ ps of oil had a particular comb@@ ination of chemicals in them which caused them to in@@ corpor@@ ate chemicals from the outside and grow the dro@@ ps of oil .
And those that were like that started to sp@@ lit and divi@@ de .
And those were the most pri@@ mi@@ tive forms of cells in a sense , those little dro@@ ps of oil .
But now those dro@@ ps of oil weren &apos;t really alive , as we say it now , because every one of them was a little random reci@@ pe of chemicals .
And every time it divi@@ ded , they got sort of une@@ qu@@ al divi@@ sion of the chemicals within them .
And so every drop was a little bit different .
In fact , the dro@@ ps that were different in a way that caused them to be better at in@@ corpor@@ ating chemicals around them , grew more and in@@ corpor@@ ated more chemicals and divi@@ ded more .
So those ten@@ ded to live longer , get expres@@ sed more .
Now that &apos;s sort of just a very simple chemical form of life , but when things got interesting was when these dro@@ ps learned a trick about abstr@@ action .
Some@@ how by ways that we don &apos;t quite understand , these little dro@@ ps learned to write down information .
They learned to record the information that was the reci@@ pe of the cell onto a particular kind of chemical called DNA .
So in other words , they worked out , in this min@@ d@@ less sort of ev@@ olutionary way , a form of writing that let them write down what they were , so that that way of writing it down could get cop@@ i@@ ed .
The amazing thing is that that way of writing seems to have sta@@ yed stea@@ dy since it evolved two and a half billion years ago .
In fact the reci@@ pe for us , our genes , is exactly that same code and that same way of writing .
In fact , every living cre@@ ature is written in exactly the same set of letters and the same code .
In fact , one of the things that I did just for am@@ us@@ ement pur@@ pos@@ es is we can now write things in this code .
And I &apos;ve got here a little 100 micro@@ gra@@ ms of white po@@ w@@ der , which I try not to let the security people see at air@@ por@@ ts .
But this has in it -- what I did is I took this code -- the code has standard letters that we use for symbo@@ li@@ zing it -- and I wrote my business card onto a piece of DNA and amp@@ li@@ fied it 10 to the 22 times .
So if anyone would like a hundred million cop@@ ies of my business card , I have pl@@ en@@ ty for everyone in the room , and , in fact , everyone in the world , and it &apos;s right here .
If I had really been a e@@ goti@@ st , I would have put it into a virus and released it in the room .
So what was the next step ?
W@@ ri@@ ting down the DNA was an interesting step .
And that caused these cells -- that kept them happy for another billion years .
But then there was another really interesting step where things became completely different , which is these cells started ex@@ changing and communi@@ cating information , so that they began to get communities of cells .
I don &apos;t know if you know this , but bacteria can actually ex@@ change DNA .
Now that &apos;s why , for instance , anti@@ bio@@ tic resi@@ stance has evolved .
Some bacteria figured out how to stay away from pen@@ ic@@ ill@@ in , and it went around sort of creating its little DNA information with other bacteria , and now we have a lot of bacteria that are resi@@ stant to pen@@ ic@@ ill@@ in , because bacteria communicate .
Now what this communication allowed was communities to form that , in some sense , were in the same boat together ; they were sy@@ ner@@ gi@@ stic .
So they survi@@ ved or they failed together , which means that if a community was very successful , all the individuals in that community were repe@@ ated more and they were fa@@ vo@@ red by evolution .
Now the transi@@ tion point happened when these communities got so close that , in fact , they got together and decided to write down the whole reci@@ pe for the community together on one string of DNA .
And so the next stage that &apos;s interesting in life took about another billion years .
And at that stage , we have multi-@@ cel@@ lu@@ lar communities , communities of lots of different types of cells , working together as a single organ@@ ism .
And in fact , we &apos;re such a multi-@@ cel@@ lu@@ lar community .
We have lots of cells that are not out for themselves anymore .
Your skin cell is really us@@ eless without a heart cell , mus@@ cle cell , a brain cell and so on .
So these communities began to evol@@ ve so that the interesting level on which evolution was taking place was no longer a cell , but a community which we call an organ@@ ism .
Now the next step that happened is within these communities .
These communities of cells , again , began to abstr@@ act information .
And they began building very special structures that did nothing but process information within the community .
And those are the ne@@ ural structures .
So neurons are the information process@@ ing appar@@ at@@ us that those communities of cells built up .
And in fact , they began to get speci@@ alists in the community and special structures that were responsible for recor@@ ding , understanding , learning information .
And that was the brains and the nervous system of those communities .
And that gave them an ev@@ olutionary advantage .
Because at that point , an individual -- learning could happen within the time sp@@ an of a single organ@@ ism , instead of over this ev@@ olutionary time sp@@ an .
So an organ@@ ism could , for instance , learn not to eat a certain kind of fru@@ it because it ta@@ sted bad and it got sick last time it ate it .
That could happen within the lifetime of a single organ@@ ism , wh@@ ereas before they &apos;d built these special information process@@ ing structures , that would have had to be learned ev@@ olu@@ tion@@ arily over hundreds of thousands of years by the individuals dying off that ate that kind of fru@@ it .
So that nervous system , the fact that they built these special information structures , tremend@@ ously sp@@ ed up the whole process of evolution .
Because evolution could now happen within an individual .
It could happen in learning time scal@@ es .
But then what happened was the individuals worked out , of course , tric@@ ks of communi@@ cating .
And for example , the most soph@@ is@@ tic@@ ated version that we &apos;re aware of is human language .
It &apos;s really a pretty amazing invention if you think about it .
Here I have a very complicated , m@@ ess@@ y , conf@@ used idea in my head .
I &apos;m sitting here making gr@@ un@@ ting sounds basically , and hopefully construc@@ ting a similar m@@ ess@@ y , conf@@ used idea in your head that be@@ ars some analo@@ gy to it .
But we &apos;re taking something very complicated , turning it into sound , sequ@@ ences of sounds , and producing something very complicated in your brain .
So this allows us now to begin to start func@@ tioning as a single organ@@ ism .
And so , in fact , what we &apos;ve done is we , humanity , have started abstr@@ acting out .
We &apos;re going through the same levels that multi-@@ cel@@ lu@@ lar organisms have gone through -- abstr@@ acting out our metho@@ ds of recor@@ ding , presen@@ ting , process@@ ing information .
So for example , the invention of language was a tiny step in that direction .
T@@ eleph@@ ony , computers , vide@@ ot@@ ap@@ es , C@@ D@@ -@@ R@@ O@@ M@@ s and so on are all our speci@@ alized mechan@@ isms that we &apos;ve now built within our society for hand@@ ling that information .
And it all connec@@ ts us together into something that is much bigger and much faster and able to evol@@ ve than what we were before .
So now , evolution can take place on a scale of micros@@ econ@@ ds .
And you saw T@@ y &apos;s little ev@@ olutionary example where he sort of did a little bit of evolution on the Con@@ v@@ olution program right before your eyes .
So now we &apos;ve spe@@ e@@ ded up the time scal@@ es once again .
So the first steps of the story that I told you about took a billion years a piece .
And the next steps , like nervous systems and brains , took a few hundred million years .
Then the next steps , like language and so on , took less than a million years .
And these next steps , like electr@@ on@@ ics , seem to be taking only a few decades .
The process is fe@@ eding on itself and becoming , I guess , au@@ to@@ cat@@ aly@@ tic is the word for it -- when something re@@ in@@ forces its rate of change .
The more it changes , the faster it changes .
And I think that that &apos;s what we &apos;re seeing here in this expl@@ os@@ ion of cur@@ ve .
We &apos;re seeing this process fe@@ eding back on itself .
Now I design computers for a living , and I know that the mechan@@ isms that I use to design computers would be impossible without recent adv@@ ances in computers .
So right now , what I do is I design objects at such complexity that it &apos;s really impossible for me to design them in the traditional sense .
I don &apos;t know what every transi@@ st@@ or in the connection machine does .
There are billions of them .
Instead , what I do and what the designers at Th@@ in@@ king Ma@@ ch@@ ines do is we think at some level of abstr@@ action and then we hand it to the machine and the machine takes it beyond what we could ever do , much far@@ ther and faster than we could ever do .
And in fact , sometimes it takes it by metho@@ ds that we don &apos;t quite even understand .
One method that &apos;s particularly interesting that I &apos;ve been using a lot l@@ ately is evolution itself .
So what we do is we put inside the machine a process of evolution that takes place on the micros@@ econ@@ d time scale .
So for example , in the most extreme cases , we can actually evol@@ ve a program by starting out with random sequ@@ ences of instruc@@ tions .
S@@ ay , &quot; Com@@ pu@@ ter , would you please make a hundred million random sequ@@ ences of instruc@@ tions .
Now would you please run all of those random sequ@@ ences of instruc@@ tions , run all of those programs , and pick out the ones that came clos@@ est to doing what I wanted . &quot;
So in other words , I define what I wanted .
Let &apos;s say I want to sort numbers , as a simple example I &apos;ve done it with .
So find the programs that come clos@@ est to sor@@ ting numbers .
So of course , random sequ@@ ences of instruc@@ tions are very un@@ likely to sort numbers , so none of them will really do it .
But one of them , by lu@@ ck , may put two numbers in the right order .
And I say , &quot; Com@@ pu@@ ter , would you please now take the 10 percent of those random sequ@@ ences that did the best job .
Sa@@ ve those . K@@ ill off the rest .
And now let &apos;s re@@ produce the ones that sor@@ ted numbers the best .
And let &apos;s re@@ produce them by a process of re@@ comb@@ ination analo@@ g@@ ous to sex . &quot;
Take two programs and they produce children by ex@@ changing their sub@@ rou@@ ti@@ n@@ es , and the children inher@@ it the tra@@ its of the sub@@ rou@@ ti@@ n@@ es of the two programs .
So I &apos;ve got now a new generation of programs that are produced by comb@@ in@@ ations of the programs that did a little bit better job .
S@@ ay , &quot; Please repe@@ at that process . &quot;
S@@ core them again .
In@@ tro@@ duce some mu@@ tations perhaps .
And try that again and do that for another generation .
Well every one of those generations just takes a few milli@@ seconds .
So I can do the equivalent of millions of years of evolution on that within the computer in a few minutes , or in the complicated cases , in a few hours .
At the end of that , I end up with programs that are absolutely perfect at sor@@ ting numbers .
In fact , they are programs that are much more efficient than programs I could have ever written by hand .
Now if I look at those programs , I can &apos;t tell you how they work .
I &apos;ve tried looking at them and telling you how they work .
They &apos;re obs@@ cure , weird programs .
But they do the job .
And in fact , I know , I &apos;m very confi@@ dent that they do the job because they come from a line of hundreds of thousands of programs that did the job .
In fact , their life depen@@ ded on doing the job .
I was ri@@ ding in a 7@@ 4@@ 7 with Mar@@ v@@ in Min@@ sky once , and he pul@@ ls out this card and says , &quot; Oh look . Look at this .
It says , &apos; This plane has hundreds of thousands of tiny parts working together to make you a safe flight . &apos; Do@@ esn &apos;t that make you feel confi@@ dent ? &quot;
In fact , we know that the engineering process doesn &apos;t work very well when it gets complicated .
So we &apos;re beginning to dep@@ end on computers to do a process that &apos;s very different than engineering .
And it lets us produce things of much more complexity than normal engineering lets us produce .
And yet , we don &apos;t quite understand the op@@ tions of it .
So in a sense , it &apos;s getting ahead of us .
We &apos;re now using those programs to make much faster computers so that we &apos;ll be able to run this process much faster .
So it &apos;s fe@@ eding back on itself .
The thing is becoming faster and that &apos;s why I think it seems so conf@@ using .
Because all of these technologies are fe@@ eding back on themselves .
We &apos;re taking off .
And what we are is we &apos;re at a point in time which is analo@@ g@@ ous to when sing@@ le-@@ cel@@ led organisms were turning into multi-@@ cel@@ led organisms .
So we &apos;re the a@@ mo@@ e@@ b@@ as and we can &apos;t quite figure out what the hell this thing is we &apos;re creating .
We &apos;re right at that point of transi@@ tion .
But I think that there really is something coming along after us .
I think it &apos;s very ha@@ u@@ gh@@ ty of us to think that we &apos;re the end product of evolution .
And I think all of us here are a part of producing whatever that next thing is .
So lunch is coming along , and I think I will stop at that point , before I get sel@@ ected out .
So a couple of years ago I started a program to try to get the ro@@ ck@@ star tech and design people to take a year off and work in the one environment that re@@ presents pretty much everything they &apos;re supposed to hate ; we have them work in government .
The program is called Co@@ de for America , and it &apos;s a little bit like a Pe@@ ace Cor@@ ps for ge@@ e@@ ks .
We sel@@ ect a few fel@@ lo@@ ws every year and we have them work with city governments .
Instead of sending them off into the Th@@ ird World , we send them into the wil@@ ds of City H@@ all .
And there they make great app@@ s , they work with city sta@@ ff@@ ers .
But really what they &apos;re doing is they &apos;re showing what &apos;s possible with technology today .
So meet Al .
Al is a fire hy@@ dr@@ ant in the city of Boston .
Here it kind of looks like he &apos;s looking for a date , but what he &apos;s really looking for is for someone to sho@@ vel him out when he gets s@@ no@@ wed in , because he knows he &apos;s not very good at fighting fi@@ res when he &apos;s covered in four feet of s@@ now .
Now how did he come to be looking for help in this very unique man@@ ner ?
We had a team of fel@@ lo@@ ws in Boston last year through the Co@@ de for America program .
They were there in Fe@@ bru@@ ary , and it s@@ no@@ wed a lot in Fe@@ bru@@ ary last year .
And they noticed that the city never gets to di@@ gging out these fire hy@@ d@@ ran@@ ts .
But one fel@@ low in particular , a guy named E@@ ri@@ k Micha@@ el@@ s-@@ O@@ ber , noticed something else , and that &apos;s that citizens are sho@@ veling out si@@ de@@ wal@@ ks right in front of these things .
So he did what any good develop@@ er would do , he wrote an ap@@ p .
It &apos;s a cu@@ te little ap@@ p where you can adop@@ t a fire hy@@ dr@@ ant .
So you agree to di@@ g it out when it s@@ no@@ ws .
If you do , you get to name it , and he called the first one Al .
And if you don &apos;t , someone can ste@@ al it from you .
So it &apos;s got cu@@ te little game dyna@@ mics on it .
This is a mod@@ est little ap@@ p .
It &apos;s probably the smal@@ lest of the 21 app@@ s that the fel@@ lo@@ ws wrote last year .
But it &apos;s doing something that no other government technology does .
It &apos;s sp@@ reading vir@@ ally .
There &apos;s a guy in the I.@@ T@@ . de@@ partment of the City of H@@ on@@ ol@@ ul@@ u who saw this ap@@ p and realized that he could use it , not for s@@ now , but to get citizens to adop@@ t t@@ su@@ nam@@ i si@@ r@@ ens .
It &apos;s very important that these t@@ su@@ nam@@ i si@@ r@@ ens work , but people ste@@ al the bat@@ ter@@ ies out of them .
So he &apos;s getting citizens to check on them .
And then Se@@ attle decided to use it to get citizens to clear out clo@@ gged stor@@ m dra@@ ins .
And Chicago just rol@@ led it out to get people to sign up to sho@@ vel si@@ de@@ wal@@ ks when it s@@ no@@ ws .
So we now know of nine cities that are planning to use this .
And this has spread just fri@@ c@@ tion@@ less@@ ly , organ@@ ically , nat@@ ur@@ ally .
If you know anything about government technology , you know that this isn &apos;t how it normally goes .
Pro@@ cur@@ ing software usually takes a couple of years .
We had a team that worked on a project in Boston last year that took three people about two and a half months .
It was a way that parents could figure out which were the right public schools for their kids .
We were told after@@ ward that if that had gone through normal chan@@ n@@ els , it would have taken at least two years and it would have cost about two million dollars .
And that &apos;s nothing .
There is one project in the California cour@@ t system right now that so far cost ta@@ x@@ pa@@ yers two billion dollars , and it doesn &apos;t work .
And there are projects like this at every level of government .
So an ap@@ p that takes a couple of days to write and then sp@@ rea@@ ds vir@@ ally , that &apos;s sort of a shot across the bo@@ w to the institu@@ tion of government .
It suggests how government could work better -- not more like a private company , as many people think it should .
And not even like a tech company , but more like the Internet itself .
And that means per@@ mis@@ sion@@ less , it means open , it means gener@@ ative .
And that &apos;s important .
But what &apos;s more important about this ap@@ p is that it re@@ presents how a new generation is t@@ ack@@ ling the problem of government -- not as the problem of an ossi@@ fied institu@@ tion , but as a problem of collective action .
And that &apos;s great news , because , it turns out , we &apos;re very good at collective action with digital technology .
Now there &apos;s a very large community of people that are building the tools that we need to do things together effectively .
It &apos;s not just Co@@ de for America fel@@ lo@@ ws , there are hundreds of people all over the country that are standing and writing civi@@ c app@@ s every day in their own communities .
They haven &apos;t given up on government .
They are fr@@ ustr@@ ated as hell with it , but they &apos;re not comp@@ la@@ ining about it , they &apos;re fi@@ x@@ ing it .
And these folks know something that we &apos;ve lost sight of .
And that &apos;s that when you stri@@ p away all your feelings about politics and the line at the D@@ M@@ V and all those other things that we &apos;re really mad about , government is , at its core , in the words of T@@ im O &apos;@@ Re@@ il@@ ly , &quot; What we do together that we can &apos;t do alone . &quot;
Now a lot of people have given up on government .
And if you &apos;re one of those people , I would ask that you re@@ consider , because things are changing .
Po@@ li@@ tics is not changing ; government is changing .
And because government ultimately der@@ i@@ ves its power from us -- remember &quot; We the people ? &quot; -- how we think about it is going to effect how that change happens .
Now I didn &apos;t know very much about government when I started this program .
And like a lot of people , I thought government was basically about getting people elec@@ ted to office .
Well after two years , I &apos;ve come to the concl@@ usion that , especially local government , is about op@@ os@@ su@@ ms .
This is the call center for the services and information line .
It &apos;s gener@@ ally where you will get if you call 3@@ 11 in your city .
If you should ever have the chance to staff your city &apos;s call center , as our fel@@ low Scot@@ t S@@ il@@ ver@@ man did as part of the program -- in fact , they all do that -- you will find that people call government with a very wide range of issues , including having an op@@ os@@ su@@ m stuck in your house .
So Scot@@ t gets this call .
He types &quot; O@@ pos@@ su@@ m &quot; into this offi@@ cial knowledge base .
He doesn &apos;t really come up with anything . He starts with animal control .
And finally , he says , &quot; Look , can you just open all the do@@ ors to your house and play music really l@@ oud and see if the thing leaves ? &quot;
So that worked . So boo@@ ya for Scot@@ t .
But that wasn &apos;t the end of the op@@ os@@ su@@ ms .
Boston doesn &apos;t just have a call center .
It has an ap@@ p , a Web and mobile ap@@ p , called C@@ i@@ tiz@@ ens Con@@ nect .
Now we didn &apos;t write this ap@@ p .
This is the work of the very smart people at the O@@ ffi@@ ce of New U@@ r@@ ban Me@@ chan@@ ics in Boston .
So one day -- this is an actual report -- this came in : &quot; O@@ pos@@ su@@ m in my tr@@ ash@@ can . Can &apos;t tell if it &apos;s dead .
How do I get this re@@ moved ? &quot;
But what happens with C@@ i@@ tiz@@ ens Con@@ nect is different .
So Scot@@ t was speaking person@@ -@@ to-@@ person .
But on C@@ i@@ tiz@@ ens Con@@ nect everything is public , so everybody can see this .
And in this case , a neighb@@ or saw it .
And the next report we got said , &quot; I walked over to this location , found the tr@@ ash@@ can behind the house .
O@@ pos@@ su@@ m ? Ch@@ ec@@ k . Li@@ ving ? Y@@ ep .
Tur@@ ned tr@@ ash@@ can on its side . Wal@@ ked home .
Goo@@ d@@ night swe@@ et op@@ os@@ su@@ m . &quot;
Pre@@ t@@ ty simple .
So this is great . This is the digital meeting the physical .
And it &apos;s also a great example of government getting in on the crow@@ d-@@ sour@@ cing game .
But it &apos;s also a great example of government as a platform .
And I don &apos;t mean necessarily a techno@@ logical definition of platform here .
I &apos;m just talking about a platform for people to help themselves and to help others .
So one citiz@@ en helped another citiz@@ en , but government played a key role here .
It connected those two people .
And it could have connected them with government services if they &apos;d been needed , but a neighb@@ or is a far better and che@@ aper alternative to government services .
When one neighb@@ or helps another , we streng@@ then our communities .
We call animal control , it just costs a lot of money .
Now one of the important things we need to think about government is that it &apos;s not the same thing as politics .
And most people get that , but they think that one is the in@@ put to the other .
That our in@@ put to the system of government is vo@@ ting .
Now how many times have we elec@@ ted a political leader -- and sometimes we spend a lot of energy getting a new political leader elec@@ ted -- and then we sit back and we expect government to refl@@ ect our values and meet our needs , and then not that much changes ?
That &apos;s because government is like a vast ocean and politics is the six@@ -@@ inch layer on top .
And what &apos;s under that is what we call bu@@ re@@ au@@ cracy .
And we say that word with such con@@ temp@@ t .
But it &apos;s that con@@ temp@@ t that ke@@ eps this thing that we own and we pay for as something that &apos;s working against us , this other thing , and then we &apos;re dise@@ mp@@ o@@ wering ourselves .
People seem to think politics is se@@ xy .
If we want this institu@@ tion to work for us , we &apos;re going to have to make bu@@ re@@ au@@ cracy se@@ xy .
Because that &apos;s where the real work of government happens .
We have to engage with the mach@@ in@@ ery of government .
So that &apos;s O@@ c@@ cu@@ p@@ y@@ the@@ S@@ E@@ C movement has done .
Have you seen these guys ?
It &apos;s a group of concerned citizens that have written a very deta@@ iled 3@@ 2@@ 5@@ -@@ page report that &apos;s a response to the S@@ E@@ C &apos;s re@@ quest for com@@ ment on the Fin@@ an@@ cial Re@@ form Bill .
That &apos;s not being poli@@ tically active , that &apos;s being bu@@ re@@ au@@ cra@@ tically active .
Now for those of us who &apos;ve given up on government , it &apos;s time that we asked ourselves about the world that we want to leave for our children .
You have to see the enormous challenges that they &apos;re going to face .
Do we really think we &apos;re going to get where we need to go without fi@@ x@@ ing the one institu@@ tion that can act on be@@ half of all of us ?
We can &apos;t do without government , but we do need it to be more effective .
The good news is that technology is making it possible to fundamen@@ tally re@@ frame the function of government in a way that can actually scale by streng@@ th@@ ening civil society .
And there &apos;s a generation out there that &apos;s grown up on the Internet , and they know that it &apos;s not that hard to do things together , you just have to archit@@ ect the systems the right way .
Now the average age of our fel@@ lo@@ ws is 28 , so I am , be@@ gr@@ u@@ d@@ gi@@ ngly , almost a generation older than most of them .
This is a generation that &apos;s grown up taking their voices pretty much for gran@@ ted .
They &apos;re not fighting that battle that we &apos;re all fighting about who gets to speak ; they all get to speak .
They can express their opini@@ on on any chan@@ nel at any time , and they do .
So when they &apos;re fac@@ ed with the problem of government , they don &apos;t care as much about using their voices .
They &apos;re using their hands .
They &apos;re using their hands to write appli@@ cations that make government work better .
And those appli@@ cations let us use our hands to make our communities better .
That could be sho@@ veling out a hy@@ dr@@ ant , pul@@ ling a we@@ ed , turning over a gar@@ b@@ age can with an op@@ os@@ su@@ m in it .
And certainly , we could have been sho@@ veling out those fire hy@@ d@@ ran@@ ts all along , and many people do .
But these app@@ s are like little digital remin@@ ders that we &apos;re not just consum@@ ers , and we &apos;re not just consum@@ ers of government , putting in our ta@@ xes and getting back services .
We &apos;re more than that , we &apos;re citizens .
And we &apos;re not going to fix government until we fix citiz@@ en@@ ship .
So the question I have for all of you here : When it comes to the big , important things that we need to do together , all of us together , are we just going to be a crow@@ d of voices , or are we also going to be a crow@@ d of hands ?
Thank you .
I would like to talk to you about why many e-@@ health projects fail .
And I really think that the most important thing of it is that we stopped listening to patients .
And one of the things we did at R@@ ad@@ b@@ oud University is we ap@@ poin@@ ted a chi@@ ef listening offi@@ cer .
Not in a very scientific way -- she puts up a little cu@@ p of coffee or cu@@ p of te@@ a and asks patients , family , rela@@ tives , &quot; What &apos;s up ?
How could we help you ? &quot;
And we think , we like to think , that this is one of the major problems why all -- maybe not all -- but most of the e-@@ health projects fail , since we stopped listening .
This is my Wi@@ F@@ i scale . It &apos;s a very simple thing .
It &apos;s got one kno@@ b , on / off .
And every morning I hop on it .
And yes , I &apos;ve got a challenge , as you might see .
And I put my challenge on 95 k@@ g .
But the thing is that it &apos;s made this simple that whenever I hop on , it sen@@ ds my data through Google H@@ eal@@ th as well .
And it &apos;s coll@@ ected by my general prac@@ ti@@ tion@@ er as well , so he can see what &apos;s my problem in weight , not on the very moment that I need car@@ dio@@ logic support or something like it , but also looking back@@ ward .
But there &apos;s another thing .
As some of you might know , I &apos;ve got more than 4@@ ,000 fol@@ lowers on Twitter .
So every morning I hop on my Wi@@ F@@ i scale and before I &apos;m in my car , people start talking to me , &quot; I think you need a light lunch today , Lu@@ ci@@ en . &quot;
But that &apos;s the nic@@ est thing that could happen , since this is pe@@ er pressure , pe@@ er pressure used to help patients -- since this could be used for ob@@ es@@ ity , it could be used to stop smo@@ king in patients .
But on the other hand , it also could be used to get people from out of their cha@@ irs and try to work together in some kind of gam@@ ing activity to get more control of their health .
As of next week , it will soon be available .
There will be this little blood pressure meter connected to an iPhone or something or other .
And people will be able , from their homes , to take their blood pressure , send it into their doctor and eventually share it with others , for instance , for over a hundred dollars .
And this is the point where patients get into position and can collect , not only their own control again , be cap@@ tain of their own ship , but also can help us in health care due to the challenges that we face , like health care cost expl@@ os@@ ion , doub@@ led demand and things like that .
Ma@@ ke techniques that are easy to use and start with this to embr@@ ace patients in the team .
And you can do this with techniques like this , but also by crow@@ d-@@ sour@@ cing .
And one of the things we did I would like to share with you introduced by a little video .
We &apos;ve all got na@@ vi@@ gation contr@@ ols in our car .
We maybe even &#91; have &#93; it in our cell@@ phone .
We know perfectly where all the A@@ T@@ M@@ s are about the city of Ma@@ as@@ tri@@ ch@@ t .
The other thing is we know where all the gas sta@@ tions are .
And sure , we could find fast food cha@@ ins .
But where would be the near@@ est A@@ ED to help this patient ?
We asked around and nobody knew .
No@@ body knew where the near@@ est life@@ -@@ saving A@@ ED was to be ob@@ ta@@ ined right now .
So what we did , we crow@@ d@@ sour@@ ced The Ne@@ ther@@ lands .
We set up a website and asked the crow@@ d , &quot; If you see an A@@ ED , please sub@@ mit it , tell us where it is , tell us when it &apos;s open , &quot; since sometimes in office hours sometimes it &apos;s closed , of course .
And over 10,000 A@@ E@@ D@@ s already in The Ne@@ ther@@ lands already have been sub@@ mit@@ ted .
The next step we took was to find the appli@@ cations for it .
And we built an iP@@ ad appli@@ cation .
We made an appli@@ cation for La@@ y@@ ar , au@@ g@@ mented reality , to find these A@@ E@@ D@@ s .
And whenever you are in a city like Ma@@ as@@ tri@@ ch@@ t and somebody collap@@ ses , you can use your iPhone , and within the next weeks also run your Microsoft cell@@ phone , to find the near@@ est A@@ ED which can save lives .
And as of today , we would like to introduce this , not only as A@@ E@@ D@@ 4@@ E@@ U , which is what the product is called , but also A@@ E@@ D@@ 4@@ U@@ S .
And we would like to start this on a worldwide level .
And &#91; we &apos;re &#93; asking all of our colleagues in the rest of the world , colleagu@@ e univer@@ si@@ ties , to help us to find and work and act like a hu@@ b to crow@@ d-@@ source all these A@@ E@@ D@@ s all around the world .
That whenever you &apos;re on ho@@ li@@ day and somebody collap@@ ses , might it be your own rela@@ tive or someone just in front of you , you can find this .
The other thing we would like to ask is of companies also all over the world that will be able to help us v@@ ali@@ date these A@@ E@@ D@@ s .
These might be cou@@ ri@@ er services or c@@ able guys for instance , just to see whether the A@@ ED that &apos;s sub@@ mit@@ ted still is in place .
So please help us on this one and try to make not only health a little bit better , but take control of it .
Thank you .
I &apos;m here to share my photograp@@ hy .
Or is it photograp@@ hy ?
Because , of course , this is a photograph that you can &apos;t take with your camera .
Yet , my interest in photograp@@ hy started as I got my first digital camera at the age of 15 .
It mi@@ xed with my earlier passion for drawing , but it was a bit different , because using the camera , the process was in the planning instead .
And when you take a photograph with a camera , the process ends when you press the tri@@ gger .
So to me it felt like photograp@@ hy was more about being at the right place and the right time .
I felt like anyone could do that .
So I wanted to create something different , something where the process starts when you press the tri@@ gger .
Ph@@ ot@@ os like this : construction going on along a bus@@ y road .
But it has an unexpected tw@@ ist .
And despite that , it re@@ tains a level of real@@ ism .
Or photos like these -- both dark and col@@ or@@ ful , but all with a common goal of re@@ ta@@ ining the level of real@@ ism .
When I say real@@ ism , I mean phot@@ o-@@ real@@ ism .
Because , of course , it &apos;s not something you can cap@@ ture really , but I always want it to look like it could have been cap@@ tured somehow as a photograph .
Ph@@ ot@@ os where you will need a bri@@ ef moment to think to figure out the trick .
So it &apos;s more about cap@@ turing an idea than about cap@@ turing a moment really .
But what &apos;s the trick that makes it look real@@ istic ?
Is it something about the details or the colors ?
Is it something about the light ?
What creates the ill@@ usion ?
Sometimes the perspective is the ill@@ usion .
But in the end , it comes down to how we interpre@@ t the world and how it can be realized on a two-@@ dimensional surface .
It &apos;s not really what is real@@ istic , it &apos;s what we think looks real@@ istic really .
So I think the basi@@ cs are quite simple .
I just see it as a puzz@@ le of reality where you can take different pieces of reality and put it together to create alter@@ nate reality .
And let me show you a simple example .
Here we have three perfectly imag@@ in@@ able physical objects , something we all can re@@ late to living in a three-@@ dimensional world .
But comb@@ ined in a certain way , they can create something that still looks three-@@ dimensional , like it could exist .
But at the same time , we know it can &apos;t .
So we trick our brains , because our brain simply doesn &apos;t accept the fact that it doesn &apos;t really make sense .
And I see the same process with comb@@ ining photographs .
It &apos;s just really about comb@@ ining different reali@@ ties .
So the things that make a photograph look real@@ istic , I think it &apos;s the things that we don &apos;t even think about , the things all around us in our daily lives .
But when comb@@ ining photographs , this is really important to consider , because otherwise it just looks wrong somehow .
So I would like to say that there are three simple rules to follow to achieve a real@@ istic result .
As you can see , these images aren &apos;t really special .
But comb@@ ined , they can create something like this .
So the first rule is that photos comb@@ ined should have the same perspective .
Secon@@ dly , photos comb@@ ined should have the same type of light .
And these two images both ful@@ fill these two requi@@ re@@ ments -- shot at the same he@@ ight and in the same type of light .
The third one is about making it impossible to disti@@ ngu@@ ish where the different images begin and end by making it se@@ am@@ less .
Ma@@ ke it impossible to say how the image actually was compos@@ ed .
So by mat@@ ching color , contr@@ ast and bri@@ ght@@ ness in the bor@@ ders between the different images , ad@@ ding photograp@@ hic def@@ ects like dep@@ th of field , des@@ atur@@ ated colors and noise , we er@@ ase the bor@@ ders between the different images and make it look like one single image , despite the fact that one image can con@@ tain hundreds of la@@ yers basically .
So here &apos;s another example .
One might think that this is just an image of a landscape and the lower part is what &apos;s manipu@@ lated .
But this image is actually entirely compos@@ ed of photographs from different lo@@ cations .
I personally think that it &apos;s easier to actually create a place than to find a place , because then you don &apos;t need to comp@@ rom@@ ise with the ideas in your head .
But it does require a lot of planning .
And getting this idea during win@@ ter , I knew that I had several months to plan it , to find the different lo@@ cations for the pieces of the puzz@@ le basically .
So for example , the fish was cap@@ tured on a fi@@ shing trip .
The sho@@ res are from a different location .
The under@@ water part was cap@@ tured in a stone p@@ it .
And yeah , I even turned the house on top of the island red to make it look more Swe@@ dish .
So to achieve a real@@ istic result , I think it comes down to planning .
It always starts with a s@@ ket@@ ch , an idea .
Then it &apos;s about comb@@ ining the different photographs .
And here every piece is very well plan@@ ned .
And if you do a good job cap@@ turing the photos , the result can be quite beautiful and also quite real@@ istic .
So all the tools are out there , and the only thing that lim@@ its us is our imagination .
Thank you .
This may sound strange , but I &apos;m a big fan of the con@@ crete block .
The first con@@ crete blocks were manufac@@ tured in 18@@ 6@@ 8 with a very simple idea : mo@@ du@@ les made of ce@@ ment of a fi@@ xed measu@@ rement that fit together .
Very quickly con@@ crete blocks became the mos@@ t-@@ used construction unit in the world .
They en@@ ab@@ led us to to build things that were larger than us , buildings , bri@@ d@@ ges , one bri@@ ck at a time .
E@@ s@@ s@@ entially con@@ crete blocks had become the building block of our time .
Al@@ most a hundred years later in 194@@ 7 , L@@ E@@ G@@ O came up with this .
It was called the Au@@ tom@@ a@@ tic B@@ in@@ ding Bri@@ ck .
And in a few short years , L@@ E@@ G@@ O bri@@ cks took place in every house@@ hold .
It &apos;s es@@ tim@@ ated that over 400 billion bri@@ cks have been produced -- or 75 bri@@ cks for every person on the planet .
You don &apos;t have to be an engineer to make beautiful houses , beautiful bri@@ d@@ ges , beautiful buildings .
L@@ E@@ G@@ O made it acc@@ es@@ sible .
L@@ E@@ G@@ O has essentially taken the con@@ crete block , the building block of the world , and made it into the building block of our imagination .
Me@@ an@@ while the exact same year , at B@@ ell L@@ ab@@ s the next revolution was about to be ann@@ oun@@ ced , the next building block .
The transi@@ st@@ or was a small plastic unit that would take us from a world of sta@@ tic bri@@ cks p@@ iled on top of each other to a world where everything was inter@@ active .
Like the con@@ crete block , the transi@@ st@@ or allows you to build much larger , more complex circu@@ its , one bri@@ ck at a time .
But there &apos;s a main difference : The transi@@ st@@ or was only for experts .
I personally don &apos;t accept this , that the building block of our time is re@@ ser@@ ved for experts , so I decided to change that .
E@@ ight years ago when I was at the Me@@ dia La@@ b , I started explor@@ ing this idea of how to put the power of engineers in the hands of artists and designers .
A few years ago I started developing li@@ tt@@ le@@ B@@ its .
Let me show you how they work .
L@@ it@@ t@@ le@@ B@@ its are electr@@ onic mo@@ du@@ les with each one specific function .
They &apos;re pre-@@ engine@@ ered to be light , sound , mot@@ ors and sens@@ ors .
And the best part about it is they s@@ na@@ p together with magne@@ ts .
So you can &apos;t put them the wrong way .
The bri@@ cks are col@@ or@@ -@@ co@@ ded .
Gre@@ en is out@@ put , blue is power , p@@ ink is in@@ put and or@@ ange is wi@@ re .
So all you need to do is s@@ na@@ p a blue to a green and very quickly you can start making larger circu@@ its .
You put a blue to a green , you can make light .
You can put a kno@@ b in between and now you &apos;ve made a little di@@ mmer .
S@@ wit@@ ch out the kno@@ b for a pul@@ se mo@@ du@@ le , which is here , and now you &apos;ve made a little blin@@ ker .
Ad@@ d this bu@@ zz@@ er for some extra p@@ unch and you &apos;ve created a noise machine .
I &apos;m going to stop that .
So beyond simple play , li@@ tt@@ le@@ B@@ its are actually pretty powerful .
Instead of having to program , to wi@@ re , to sol@@ der , li@@ tt@@ le@@ B@@ its allow you to program using very simple intui@@ tive ge@@ stu@@ res .
So to make this b@@ link faster or s@@ lower , you would just turn this kno@@ b and basically make it pul@@ se faster or s@@ lower .
The idea behind li@@ tt@@ le@@ B@@ its is that it &apos;s a growing libr@@ ary .
We want to make every single interaction in the world into a read@@ y-@@ to-@@ use bri@@ ck .
Li@@ ghts , sounds , solar pan@@ els , mot@@ ors -- everything should be acc@@ es@@ sible .
We &apos;ve been giving li@@ tt@@ le@@ B@@ its to kids and seeing them play with them .
And it &apos;s been an incredible experience .
The nic@@ est thing is how they start to understand the electr@@ on@@ ics around them from everyday that they don &apos;t learn at schools .
For example , how a ni@@ ght@@ light works , or why an el@@ ev@@ ator door sta@@ ys open , or how an iP@@ od respon@@ ds to touch .
We &apos;ve also been taking li@@ tt@@ le@@ B@@ its to design schools .
So for example , we &apos;ve had designers with no experience with electr@@ on@@ ics what@@ so@@ ever start to play with li@@ tt@@ le@@ B@@ its as a material .
Here you see , with felt and paper water bot@@ tles , we have Geor@@ die making ...
A few weeks ago we took li@@ tt@@ le@@ B@@ its to R@@ I@@ S@@ D and gave them to some designers with no experience in engineering what@@ so@@ ever -- just car@@ d@@ board , wood and paper -- and told them &quot; Ma@@ ke something . &quot;
Here &apos;s an example of a project they made , a mo@@ tion@@ -@@ activ@@ ated con@@ fe@@ tt@@ i can@@ on ball .
But wait , this is actually my favorite project .
It &apos;s a lob@@ ster made of pla@@ y@@ d@@ ough that &apos;s afraid of the dark .
To these non-@@ engineers , li@@ tt@@ le@@ B@@ its became another material , electr@@ on@@ ics became just another material .
And we want to make this material acc@@ es@@ sible to everyone .
So li@@ tt@@ le@@ B@@ its is open-@@ source .
You can go on the website , down@@ load all the design fil@@ es , make them yourself .
We want to encoura@@ ge a world of cre@@ ators , of inven@@ tors , of contribu@@ tors , because this world that we live in , this inter@@ active world , is ours .
So go ahead and start inven@@ ting .
Thank you .
In the 198@@ 0s in the communi@@ st E@@ a@@ stern Germany , if you ow@@ ned a ty@@ pe@@ writer , you had to regi@@ ster it with the government .
You had to regi@@ ster a sample she@@ et of text out of the ty@@ pe@@ writer .
And this was done so the government could track where text was coming from .
If they found a paper which had the wrong kind of thought , they could track down who created that thought .
And we in the West couldn &apos;t understand how anybody could do this , how much this would re@@ strict freedom of speech .
We would never do that in our own countries .
But today in 2011 , if you go and buy a color laser prin@@ ter from any major laser prin@@ ter manufac@@ tu@@ re@@ r and print a page , that page will end up having s@@ light yellow dots prin@@ ted on every single page in a pattern which makes the page unique to you and to your prin@@ ter .
This is happening to us today .
And nobody seems to be making a f@@ us@@ s about it .
And this is an example of the ways that our own governments are using technology against us , the citizens .
And this is one of the main three sources of online problems today .
If we take a look at what &apos;s really happening in the online world , we can group the att@@ acks based on the att@@ ack@@ ers .
We have three main groups .
We have online crimin@@ als .
Like here , we have Mr. Di@@ mi@@ try G@@ olu@@ bo@@ v from the city of Ki@@ e@@ v in U@@ k@@ ra@@ ine .
And the mo@@ tives of online crimin@@ als are very easy to understand .
These guys make money .
They use online att@@ acks to make lots of money , and lots and lots of it .
We actually have several cases of milli@@ on@@ ai@@ res online , mul@@ tim@@ illi@@ on@@ ai@@ res , who made money with their att@@ acks .
Here &apos;s V@@ la@@ di@@ mi@@ r T@@ sa@@ st@@ sin form T@@ art@@ u in E@@ st@@ on@@ ia .
This is Al@@ f@@ red G@@ on@@ z@@ al@@ e@@ z .
This is Steph@@ en Wat@@ t .
This is B@@ j@@ or@@ n Sun@@ d@@ in .
This is Mat@@ the@@ w An@@ der@@ son , T@@ ari@@ q Al@@ -@@ Da@@ our and so on and so on .
These guys make their fortu@@ n@@ es online , but they make it through the il@@ legal means of using things like ban@@ king tro@@ j@@ ans to ste@@ al money from our bank accoun@@ ts while we do online ban@@ king , or with ke@@ y@@ lo@@ gg@@ ers to collect our credit card information while we are doing online sho@@ pping from an infected computer .
The U.S. Sec@@ re@@ t Ser@@ vice , two months ago , fro@@ ze the S@@ wis@@ s bank account of Mr. S@@ am Ja@@ in right here , and that bank account had 14@@ .@@ 9 million U.S. dollars on it when it was fro@@ zen .
Mr. Ja@@ in himself is on the lo@@ ose ; nobody knows where he is .
And I cla@@ im it &apos;s already today that it &apos;s more likely for any of us to become the vic@@ tim of a crime online than here in the real world .
And it &apos;s very obvious that this is only going to get worse .
In the future , the majority of crime will be happening online .
The second major group of att@@ ack@@ ers that we are watching today are not motiv@@ ated by money .
They &apos;re motiv@@ ated by something else -- motiv@@ ated by prot@@ ests , motiv@@ ated by an opini@@ on , motiv@@ ated by the laugh@@ s .
G@@ rou@@ ps like An@@ onym@@ ous have ris@@ en up over the last 12 months and have become a major player in the field of online att@@ acks .
So those are the three main att@@ ack@@ ers : crimin@@ als who do it for the money , hack@@ tivi@@ sts like An@@ onym@@ ous doing it for the prot@@ est , but then the last group are nation states , governments doing the att@@ acks .
And then we look at cases like what happened in Di@@ gi@@ N@@ ot@@ ar .
This is a pri@@ me example of what happens when governments attack against their own citizens .
Di@@ gi@@ N@@ ot@@ ar is a C@@ er@@ ti@@ fic@@ ate Au@@ th@@ ority from The Ne@@ ther@@ lands -- or actually , it was .
It was running into ban@@ k@@ rup@@ t@@ cy last fall because they were h@@ acked into .
Some@@ body bro@@ ke in and they h@@ acked it th@@ or@@ ou@@ gh@@ ly .
And I asked last week in a meeting with Du@@ t@@ ch government represen@@ ta@@ tives , I asked one of the leaders of the team whether he found pla@@ usi@@ ble that people died because of the Di@@ gi@@ N@@ ot@@ ar h@@ ack .
And his answer was yes .
So how do people die as the result of a h@@ ack like this ?
Well Di@@ gi@@ N@@ ot@@ ar is a C@@ .@@ A.
They sell cer@@ ti@@ fic@@ ates .
What do you do with cer@@ ti@@ fic@@ ates ?
Well you need a cer@@ ti@@ fic@@ ate if you have a website that has h@@ tt@@ ps , S@@ S@@ L en@@ cr@@ yp@@ ted services , services like G@@ mail .
Now we all , or a big part of us , use G@@ mail or one of their competi@@ tors , but these services are especially popular in tot@@ al@@ it@@ arian states like Iran , where dis@@ si@@ dents use foreign services like G@@ mail because they know they are more tru@@ st@@ wor@@ thy than the local services and they are en@@ cr@@ yp@@ ted over S@@ S@@ L connections , so the local government can &apos;t s@@ no@@ o@@ p on their discus@@ sions .
Ex@@ cept they can if they h@@ ack into a foreign C@@ .@@ A.
and issue ro@@ gue cer@@ ti@@ fic@@ ates .
And this is exactly what happened with the case of Di@@ gi@@ N@@ ot@@ ar .
What about Arab S@@ pr@@ ing and things that have been happening , for example , in Egyp@@ t ?
Well in Egyp@@ t , the ri@@ ot@@ ers lo@@ ot@@ ed the head@@ quar@@ ters of the Egyp@@ ti@@ an secret police in A@@ pri@@ l 2011 , and when they were loo@@ ting the building they found lots of p@@ apers .
A@@ mong those p@@ apers , was this b@@ in@@ der enti@@ t@@ led &quot; F@@ I@@ N@@ F@@ I@@ S@@ H@@ E@@ R . &quot;
And within that b@@ in@@ der were notes from a company based in Germany which had sold the Egyp@@ ti@@ an government a set of tools for inter@@ cep@@ ting -- and in very large scale -- all the communication of the citizens of the country .
They had sold this tool for 2@@ 8@@ 0,000 Euro@@ s to the Egyp@@ ti@@ an government .
The company head@@ quar@@ ters are right here .
So Western governments are provi@@ ding tot@@ al@@ it@@ arian governments with tools to do this against their own citizens .
But Western governments are doing it to themselves as well .
For example , in Germany , just a couple of weeks ago the so@@ -@@ called St@@ ate T@@ ro@@ j@@ an was found , which was a tro@@ j@@ an used by Ger@@ man government offi@@ ci@@ als to investi@@ gate their own citizens .
If you are a sus@@ p@@ ect in a crimin@@ al case , well it &apos;s pretty obvious , your phone will be t@@ apped .
But today , it goes beyond that .
They will ta@@ p your Internet connection .
They will even use tools like St@@ ate T@@ ro@@ j@@ an to inf@@ ect your computer with a tro@@ j@@ an , which en@@ ables them to watch all your communication , to listen to your online discus@@ sions , to collect your pass@@ words .
Now when we think deeper about things like these , the obvious response from people should be that , &quot; Okay , that sounds bad , but that doesn &apos;t really affect me because I &apos;m a legal citiz@@ en .
Why should I worry ?
Because I have nothing to hi@@ de . &quot;
And this is an argument , which doesn &apos;t make sense .
Pri@@ v@@ acy is impli@@ ed .
Pri@@ v@@ acy is not up for discus@@ sion .
This is not a question between priv@@ acy against security .
It &apos;s a question of freedom against control .
And while we might trust our governments right now , right here in 2011 , any right we give away will be given away for good .
And do we trust , do we blin@@ dly trust , any future government , a government we might have 50 years from now ?
And these are the questions that we have to worry about for the next 50 years .
